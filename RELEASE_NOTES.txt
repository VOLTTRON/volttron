The VOLTTRON 1.0 release includes the following features:

 * Scheduler 2.0: The new scheduler allows applications to reserve devices ahead of time
 * SchedulerExample: This simple agent provides an example of publishing a schedule request.

VOLTTRON v1.0 also includes features in a beta stage. These features are slated for release in v1.1 but are included in 1.0 for those who wish to begin investigating them.  These features are:

 * Multi-node communication: Enables platforms to publish and subscribe to each other
 * BACNet Driver: Enables reading/writing to devices using the BACNet protocol

Included are PNNL developed applications: AFDD and DR which are in the process of being modified to work with the new scheduler.DR will not currently function with Scheduler 2.0.

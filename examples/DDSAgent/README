This agent example is meant to be run the command line, as opposed to
installing it like other agents. From this directory the command to start
it is:

$ AGENT_CONFIG=config python -m ddsagent.agent

The rticonnextdds-connector library needs to be installed for this example
to function properly. We'll retrieve it from github since it is not available
through pip. Download the source with

$ wget https://github.com/rticommunity/rticonnextdds-connector/archive/master.zip

and unpack it in DDSAgent/ddsagent with

$ unzip master.zip

The demo_publish() output can be viewed with the rtishapesdemo available
from rti.

The scripts directory is a central store for time saving interactions with
the shell and/or python scripts that automate as much as possible the 
administration of a volttron platform.

The admin directory is meant for one off scripts that will do a job and not 
generally are not meant to be called from other scripts.  For example the
volttron script is for launching volttron as a service using init.d or some
other mechanism.

bacnet contains scripts used for discovering devices and points used for
creating drivers.

The core directory is meant to have scripts that automate specific portions
of the technology stack in order to allow instances to configure themselves
effectively.

debugging can be used to get status on an install and perform debugging tasks
such as getting versions of all agents, registering platforms, etc.

development contains scripts for debugging agents in an IDE. These scripts
allow agents in Eclipse or Pycharm to interact with the platform.

drivers contains scripts for running drivers outside the platform for use in
debugging.

historian-scripts has scripts needed for setting up historian databases.

scalability-testing has scripts used for launching large numbers of platform
instances for testing of scalability.

tagging_scripts contains scripts for using the new tagging service


NOTE
All scripts should be run in an activated environment in order to use the 
command line interface for volttron.  In general scripts should be executed 
from the root volttron directory not from the scripts directory itself.

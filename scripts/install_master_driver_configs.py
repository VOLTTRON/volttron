description = """
Updates the contents of the Master Driver configuration store with a set of
configurations in a directory. This is designed to work with the output of
the update_master_driver_config.py script.

The script expects the target directory to have the following files and directories:

config              #The main configuration file
registry_configs    #A directory with all registry files in CSV format.
devices             #A directory with subdirectories and/or device configuration files.

The path to a device configuration file in the devices directory will be
used to created the name of the configuration in the store and therefore
 the topic that will associated with the device.

For example:

A device configuration with the path "devices/campus/building/my_device" will
be named "devices/campus/building/my_device" when added to the Master Driver
configuration store.

All other files and directories are ignored.

The VOLTTRON platform must be running in order for this script to work.

Any errors in the configurations will cause the process to stop with an error.

By default this will delete the old master driver configuration store before
adding new configurations.

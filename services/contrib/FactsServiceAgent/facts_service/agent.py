Ecorithm Facts Service Agent

This agent sends collected data to Ecorithm's Facts Service API using HTTPS
requests.

Each request must be authenticated using an username/password pair provided
by Ecorithm. Authentication is configured in the Facts Service parameters
group of the config.

If the Building Automation System (BAS) being trended belong to a unique
building, the `building_id` parameter must be set to match the building number
provided by Ecorithm. Topic to building_id mapping must be empty (`{}`).

If the BAS trends multiple buildings or a campus, the `building_id` must be
set to `null` and the `topic_building_mapping` must be filled.

Note that this agent won't be able to read data stored on Facts Service such
as the SQLHistorian would be able to. It is only unidirectional.

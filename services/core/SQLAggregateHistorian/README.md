# SQL Aggregate Historian 

An aggregate historian computes aggregates of data stored in a given
volttron historian\'s data store. It runs periodically to compute
aggregate data and store it in new tables/collections in the
historian\'s data store. Each historian implementation would use a
corresponding aggregate historian to compute and store aggregates.

Aggregates can be defined for a specific time interval and can be
calculated for one or more topics. For example, 15 minute average of
topic1 or 15 minute average of values of topic1 and topic2. Current
version of this agent only computes aggregates supported by underlying
data store. When aggregation is done over more than one topic a unique
aggregation topic name should be configured by user. This topic name can
be used in historian\'s query api to query the collected aggregate data.

Note: This agent doesn\'t not compute dynamic aggregates. It is only
useful when you know what kind of aggregate you would need before hand
and have them be collected periodically so that retrieval of that data
at a later point would be faster

## Data flow between historian and aggregate historian

1.  Historian collects data from devices and stores it in its data store
2.  Aggregate historian periodically queries historian\'s data store for data within configured time period.
3.  Aggregate historian computes aggregates and stores it in  historian\'s data store
4.  Historian\'s query api queries aggregate data when used with additional parameters - agg_type, agg_period

## Configuration

``` {.python}
{
    # configuration from mysql historian - START
    "connection": {
        "type": "mysql",
        "params": {
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": 3306,
            "database": "test_historian",
            "user": "historian",
            "passwd": "historian"
        }
    },
    # configuration from mysql historian - END
    # If you are using a differnt historian(sqlite3, mongo etc.) replace the
    # above with connection details from the corresponding historian.
    # the rest of the configuration would be the same for all aggregate
    # historians

    "aggregations":[
        # list of aggregation groups each with unique aggregation_period and
        # list of points that needs to be collected. value of "aggregations" is
        # a list. you can configure this agent to collect multiple aggregates.
        # aggregation_time_periiod + aggregation topic(s) together uniquely
        # identify an aggregation

        {
            # can be minutes(m), hours(h), weeks(w), or months(M)

            # Should aggregation period align to calendar time periods.
            # Default False
            # Example,

            # example periods: 10.15-11.15, 11.15-12.15, 12.15-13.15 etc.
            # if "aggregation_period":"1h" and "use_calendar_time_periods": True
            # example periods: 10.00-11.00, 11.00-12.00, 12.00-13.00 etc.

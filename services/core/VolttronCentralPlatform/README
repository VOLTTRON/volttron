The platform agent exposes the volttron platform to a volttron central
instance.  The volttron central instances can then start, stop, install, and
run methods on agents on this volttron platform.  The current design of the
platform agent allows it only to be controlled by a single volttron central
agent.

There are two modes of registration with a volttron central instance.  The 
platform agent can be configured with a hard coded value of the volttron
central, or the volttron central platform can request to manage a specific
platform agent.

All configuration options for the platform agent are optional

Configuration
-------------

A volttron_central_vip_address should contain the vip_address location that
the volttron central agent is running.  If specified the management of the
platform will be static.

"volttron_central_vip_address": "ipc://@/tmp/v1home/run/vip.socket"

The volttron_central_vip_identity allows the customization of the volttron
central identity from within the volttron central vip address.

"volttron_central_vip_identity": "volttron.central";

The agentid does not have to be unique.  It is what will be used
as a human readable name on volttron central.  If it is not set the
default 'platform' will be used.

"agentid": "platform",

The agent type in the future will allow the aggregation of agents of a
specific type across all of the platforms within volttron central.

"agent_type": "platform",

The vip_identity is how the platform agent will be known within a specific
volttron instance.  This should not be set in general as it is set
internally to a known name "platform.agent" which is guaranteed to be
unique within a vip_address network.

"vip_identity": "platform.agent",

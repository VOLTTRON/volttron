# Influxdb Historian

InfluxDB is an open source time series database with a fast, scalable
engine and high availability. It\'s often used to build DevOps
Monitoring (Infrastructure Monitoring, Application Monitoring, Cloud
Monitoring), IoT Monitoring, and Real-Time Analytics solutions.

More information about InfluxDB is available from
<https://www.influxdata.com/>.

## Prerequisites

### InfluxDB Installation

To install InfluxDB on an Ubuntu or Debian operating system, run the
script:

>     services/core/InfluxdbHistorian/scripts/install-influx.sh

For installation on other operating systems, see
<https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.4/introduction/installation/>.

### Authentication in InfluxDB

By default, the InfluxDB *Authentication* option is disabled, and no
user authentication is required to access any InfluxDB database. You can
enable authentication by updating the InfluxDB configuration file. For
detailed information on enabling authentication, see:
<https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.4/query_language/authentication_and_authorization/>.

If *Authentication* is enabled, authorization privileges are enforced.
There must be at least one defined admin user with access to
administrative queries as outlined in the linked document above.
Additionally, you must pre-create the `user` and `database` that are
specified in the configuration file (the default configuration file for
InfluxDB is `services/core/InfluxdbHistorian/config`). If your `user` is
a non-admin user, they must be granted a full set of privileges on the
desired `database`.

### InfluxDB Driver

In order to connect to an InfluxDb client, the Python library for
InfluxDB must be installed in VOLTTRON\'s virtual environment. From the
command line, after enabling the virtual environment, install the
InfluxDB library as follows:

>     pip install influxdb

## Configuration

The default configuration file for VOLTTRON\'s InfluxDBHistorian agent
should be in the format:

``` {.python}
{
  "connection": {
    "params": {
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": 8086,         # Don't change this unless default bind port
                            # in influxdb config is changed
      "database": "historian",
      "user": "historian",  # user is optional if authentication is turned off
      "passwd": "historian" # passwd is optional if authentication is turned off
    }
  },
  "aggregations": {
    "use_calendar_time_periods": true
  }
}
```

The InfluxDBHistorian agent can be packaged, installed and started
according to the standard VOLTTRON agent creation procedure. A sample
VOLTTRON configuration file has been provided:
`services/core/InfluxdbHistorian/config`.



## Connection

The `host`, `database`, `user` and `passwd` values in the VOLTTRON
configuration file can be modified. `user` and `passwd` are optional if
InfluxDB *Authentication* is disabled.

> **_Note:_**
Be sure to initialize or pre-create the `database` and `user` that you
defined in the configuration file, and if `user` is a non-admin user, be
make sure to grant privileges for the user on the specified `database`.
For more information, see [Authentication in
InfluxDB](#authentication-in-influxdb).


## Aggregations

In order to use aggregations, the VOLTTRON configuration file must also
specify a value, either `true` or `false`, for
`use_calendar_time_periods`, indicating whether the aggregation period
should align to calendar time periods. If this value is omitted from the
configuration file, aggregations cannot be used.

For more information on historian aggregations, see:
`Aggregate Historian Agent Specification <AggregateHistorianSpec>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}.

Supported Influxdb aggregation functions:

> Aggregations: COUNT(), DISTINCT(), INTEGRAL(), MEAN(), MEDIAN(),
> MODE(), SPREAD(), STDDEV(), SUM()
>
> Selectors: FIRST(), LAST(), MAX(), MIN()
>
> Transformations: CEILING(),CUMULATIVE_SUM(), DERIVATIVE(),
> DIFFERENCE(), ELAPSED(), NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE(),
> NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE()

More information how to use those functions:
<https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.4/query_language/functions/>

> **_Note:_** 
Historian aggregations in InfluxDB are different from aggregations
employed by other historian agents in VOLTTRON. InfluxDB doesn\'t have a
separate agent for aggregations. Instead, aggregation is supported
through the `query_historian` function. Other agents can execute an
aggregation query directly in InfluxDB by calling the *RPC.export*
method `query`. For an example, see 
[Aggregate Historian Agent Specification](https://volttron.readthedocs.io/en/develop/developing-volttron/developing-agents/specifications/aggregate.html)
 

# Database Schema

Each InfluxDB database has a `meta` table as well as other tables for
different measurements, e.g. one table for \"power_kw\", one table for
\"energy\", one table for \"voltage\", etc. (An InfluxDB `measurement`
is similar to a relational table, so for easier understanding, InfluxDB
measurements will be referred to below as tables.)

## Measurement Table

Example: If a topic name is *\"CampusA/Building1/Device1/Power_KW\"*,
the `power_kw` table might look as follows:

  |time                            | building  | campus  | device   | source  | value |
  |--------------------------------|-----------|---------|----------|---------|-------|
  |2017-12-28T20:41:00.004260096Z  | building1 | campusa | device1  | scrape  | 123.4 |
  |2017-12-30T01:05:00.004435616Z  | building1 | campusa | device1  | scrape  | 567.8 |
  |2018-01-15T18:08:00.126345Z     | building1 | campusa | device1  | scrape  | 10    |
 
`building`, `campus`, `device`, and `source` are InfluxDB *tags*.
`value` is an InfluxDB *field*.

> **_Note:_** 
The topic is converted to all lowercase before being stored in the
table. In other words, a set of *tag* names, as well as a table name,
are created by splitting `topic_id` into substrings ([Meta Table section below](#Meta-Table)).
:::

So in this example, where the typical format of a topic name is
`<campus>/<building>/<device>/<measurement>`, `campus`, `building` and
`device` are each stored as tags in the database.

A topic name might not confirm to that convention:

1. The topic name might contain additional substrings, e.g.  *CampusA/Building1/LAB/Device/OutsideAirTemperature*. 
In this case, `campus` will be *campusa/building*, `building` will be *lab*, and `device` will be *device*.
2. The topic name might contain fewer substrings, e.g. *LAB/Device/OutsideAirTemperature*. In this case, the `campus` 
tag will be empty, `building` will be *lab*, and `device` will be  *device*.

## Meta Table

The meta table will be structured as in the following example:

  
  |time                  |  last_updated                    |               meta_dict                 |    topic                             |       topic_id                       |
  |----------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
  |1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  | 2017-12-28T20:47:00.003051+00:00 | {u\'units\': u\'kw\',<br> u\'tz\': u\'US/Pacific\', <br> u\'type\': u\'float\'} |  CampusA/Building1/Device1/Power_KW  |  campusa/building1/device1/power_kw  |
  |1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  | 2017-12-28T20:47:00.003051+00:00 | {u\'units\': u\'kwh\',<br> u\'tz\':  u\'US/Pacific\',<br> u\'type\': u\'float\'} | CampusA/Building1/Device1/Energy_KWH | campusa/building1/device1/energy_kwh |
                                                                                                       
  |----------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|

In the InfluxDB, `last_updated`, `meta_dict` and `topic` are *fields* and `topic_id` is a *tag*.

Since InfluxDB is a time series database, the `time` column is required, and a dummy value 
(`time=0`, which is 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z based on epoch unix time) is assigned to all topics for easier metadata 
updating. Hence, if the contents of `meta_dict` change for a specific topic, both `last_updated` and `meta_dict` values 
for that topic will be replaced in the table.

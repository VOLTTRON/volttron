MQTT Historian
==============

Overview
--------
The MQTT Historian agent publishes data to an MQTT broker.

The mqttlistener.py script will connect to the broker and print
all messages.

Dependencies
------------
The Paho MQTT library from Eclipse is needed for the agent and can
be installed with:

    pip install paho-mqtt

The Mosquitto MQTT broker may be useful for testing and can be installed with

    apt-get install mosquitto

Load data publisher to publish data to the message bus (remember to change input data file in the config file)
	./scripts/core/pack_install.sh examples/DataPublisher/ examples/DataPublisher/airside_test_publisher.config publisher

Start/stop agents:
- volttron-ctl status
- volttron-ctl start <id>|<tag_name>

Connect to the web console on your crate cluster and run a query to view data

------Status:-----
CrateHistorian is still alpha, schemas could change in the future, do not use this for production data until schema is confirmed as final
Currently the historian supports two schemas for numerical data, the primary schema closely resembles the SQLHistorian schema but there
is an optional "raw" schema that can be enabled in the config below that utilizes some of the advanced indexing features of crate


Below is the sample config

{
    "connection": {
        "type": "crate",
        "schema": "testing",
        "params": {
            "host": "localhost:4200"
        }
    },
    "raw_schema_enabled": false
}

In order to use mysql one must install the mysql-python connector

From an activated shell execute

  pip install --allow-external mysql-connector-python mysql-connector-python

If the above command doesn't work then you could use the following instead

  pip install mysql-connector-python-rf


Notes for historians other than sqlite3.

The mysql user must have READ, WRITE, UPDATE, and DElETE privileges.

The tables in the sql database will not be created as part of the execution
of the SQLHistorianAgent.  There is a mysql-create.sql script as well as
a mysql-drop.sql script for your convenience.

On Ubuntu 16.04

pip install does not work. Please download the connector from
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/xenial/+package/python-mysql.connector
and follow instructions on README

# SQLHistorian 

This is a historian agent that writes data to a SQLite, Mysql, Postgres,
TimeScale, or Redshift database based on the connection parameters in
the configuration. The sql historian has been programmed to allow for
inconsistent network connectivity (automatic re-connection to tcp based
databases). All additions to the historian are batched and wrapped
within a transaction with commit and rollback functions properly
implemented. This allows the maximum throughput of data with the most
protection.

## MySQL

### Installation notes

1.  In order to support timestamp with microseconds you need at least
    MySql 5.6.4. Please see this [MySql
    documentation](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/fractional-seconds.html)
    for more details
2.  The mysql user must have SELECT INSERT, and DELETE privileges to the
    historian database tables.
3.  SQLHistorianAgent can create the database tables the first time it
    runs if the database user has CREATE privileges. But we recommend
    this only for development/test environments. For all other use
    cases, use the mysql-create\*.sql script to create the tables and
    then start agent. This way database user used by VOLTTRON historian
    can work with minimum required privileges

### Dependencies

In order to use mysql one must install the **mysql-python connector**

From an activated shell execute
```
pip install mysql-connector-python-rf
```
On Ubuntu 16.04
 > pip install does not work. Please download the connector from
 > <https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/xenial/+package/python-mysql.connector> and follow instructions on README

### Configuration

The following is a minimal configuration file for using a MySQL based
historian. Other options are available and are documented
<http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-connectargs.html>.
**Not all mysql connection parameters have been tested, use at your own
risk**. The configurations can be provided in JSON format or yml format

JSON format :

    {
        "connection": {
            # type should be "mysql"
            "type": "mysql",
            # additional mysql connection parameters could be added but
            # have not been tested
            "params": {
                "host": "localhost",
                "port": 3306,
                "database": "volttron",
                "user": "user",
                "passwd": "pass"
            }
        }
    }

YML format :

    connection:
        type: mysql
        params:
            host: localhost
            port: 3306
            database: test_historian
            user: historian
            passwd: historian

## SQLite3

An Sqlite historian provides a convenient solution for under powered
systems. The database parameter is a location on the file system. By
default it is relative to the agents installation directory, however it
will respect a rooted or relative path to the database.

### Configuration

    {
        "connection": {
            # type should be sqlite
            "type": "sqlite",
            "params": {
                "database": "data/historian.sqlite",
            }
        }
    }

## PostgreSQL and Redshift

### Installation notes

1.  The PostgreSQL database driver supports recent PostgreSQL versions.
    It was tested on 10.x, but should work with 9.x and 11.x.
2.  The user must have SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE privileges on
    historian tables.
3.  The tables in the database are created as part of the execution of
    the SQLHistorianAgent, but this will fail if the database user does
    not have CREATE privileges.
4.  Care must be exercised when using multiple historians with the same
    database. This configuration may be used only if there is no overlap
    in the topics handled by each instance. Otherwise, duplicate topic
    IDs may be created, producing strange results.
5.  Redshift databases do not support unique constraints. Therefore, it
    is possible that tables may contain some duplicate data. The
    Redshift driver handles this by using distinct queries. It does not
    remove duplicates from the tables.

### Dependencies

The PostgreSQL and Redshift database drivers require the **psycopg2**
Python package.

From an activated shell execute:
```
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

### Configuration

The following are minimal configuration files for using a psycopg2-based
historian. Other options are available and are documented
<http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/module.html> **Not all parameters have
been tested, use at your own risk**.

#### Local PostgreSQL Database

The following snippet demonstrates how to configure the
SQLHistorianAgent to use a PostgreSQL database on the local system that
is configured to use Unix domain sockets. The user executing volttron
must have appropriate privileges.
```
    {
        "connection": {
            "type": "postgresql", 
            "params": { "dbname": "volttron" }
        }
    }

#### Remote PostgreSQL Database

The following snippet demonstrates how to configure the
SQLHistorianAgent to use a remote PostgreSQL database.
```
    {
        "connection": {
            "type": "postgresql", 
            "params": { 
                "dbname": "volttron", 
                "host": "historian.example.com", 
                "port": 5432, 
                "user": "volttron", 
                "password": "secret" }
        }
    }

#### TimescaleDB Support

Both of the above PostgreSQL connection types can make use of
TimescaleDB\'s high performance Hypertable backend for the primary
timeseries table. The agent assumes you have completed the TimescaleDB
installation and setup the database by following the instructions here:
<https://docs.timescale.com/latest/getting-started/setup> To use, simply
add \'timescale_dialect: true\' to the connection params in the Agent
Config as below

```
    {
        "connection": {
            "type": "postgresql", 
            "params": { 
                "dbname": "volttron", 
                "host": "historian.example.com", 
                "port": 5432, 
                "user": "volttron", 
                "password": "secret" ,
                "timescale_dialect": true }
        }

    }
```

#### Redshift Database

The following snippet demonstrates how to configure the
SQLHistorianAgent to use a Redshift database.

```
    {
        "connection": {
            "type": "redshift", 
            "params": { 
                "dbname": "volttron", 
                "host": "historian.example.com", 
                "port": 5432, 
                "user": "volttron", 
                "password": "secret" }
        }
    }
```  

## Notes

Do not use the \"identity\" setting in configuration file. Instead use
the new method provided by the platform to set an agent\'s identity. See
scripts/core/make-sqlite-historian.sh for an example of how this is
done. Setting a historian\'s VIP IDENTITY from its configuration file
will not be supported after VOLTTRON 4.0. Using the identity
configuration setting will override the value provided by the platform.
This new value will not be reported correctly by \'volttron-ctl status\'

# SQLite Tagging Service 

SQLite tagging service provide APIs to tag both topic names(device
points) and topic name prefixes (campus, building, unit/equipment, sub
unit) and then query for relevant topics based on saved tag names and
values. The SQLite tagging services stores the tags in a sqlite3
database and hence provides a way to use this feature in VOLTTRON out of
the box.

Tags used by this agent are not user defined. They have to be
pre-defined in a resource file at volttron_data/tagging_resources. The
agent validates against this predefined list of tags every time user add
tags to topics. Tags can be added to one topic at a time or multiple
topics by using a topic name pattern(regular expression). This agent
uses tags from [project haystack](https://project-haystack.org/). and
adds a few custom tags for campus and VOLTTRON point name.

Each tag has an associated value and users can query for topic names
based tags and its values using a simplified sql-like query string.
Queries can specify tag names with values or tags without values for
boolean tags(markers). Queries can combine multiple conditions with
keyword AND and OR, and use the keyword NOT to negate a conditions.

## Dependencies and Limitations

1.  When adding tags to topics this agent calls the
    platform.historian\'s get_topic_list and hence requires the
    platform.historian to be running but it doesn\'t require the
    historian to use sqlite or any specific database. It does not
    require platform.historian to be running for using its query APIs.
2.  Resource files that provides the list of valid tags is mandatory and
    should be in volttron_data/tagging_reosurces/tags.csv
3.  Tagging service only provides APIs query for topic names based on
    tags. Once the list of topic names is retrieved, users should use
    the historian APIs to get the data corresponding to those topics.
4.  Since RDMS is not a natural fit for tagname=value kind of data,
    performance of queries will not be high if you have several
    thousands of topics and several hundreds tags for each topic and
    perform complex queries. For intermediate level data and query
    complexity, performance can be improved by increasing the page limit
    of sqlite.
5.  Current version of tagging service does not support versioning of
    tag/values. When tags values set using tagging service APIs
    update/overwrite any existing tag entries in the database

## Configuration Options

The following JSON configuration file shows all the options currently
supported by this agent.

``` {.python}
{
    # sqlite connection parameters
    "connection": {
        "type": "sqlite",
        "params": {
            "database": "~/.volttron/data/volttron.tags.sqlite"
        }
    },
    # optional. Specify if collections created for tagging should have names
    # starting with a specific prefix <given prefix>_<collection_name>
    "table_prefix":"volttron",

    # optional. Specify if you want tagging service to query the historian
    # with this vip identity. defaults to platform.historian
    "historian_vip_identity": "crate.historian"
}
```

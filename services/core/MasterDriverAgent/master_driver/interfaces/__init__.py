==================
Driver Development
==================

New drivers are implemented by subclassing :py:class:`BaseInterface`.

While it is possible to create an Agent which handles communication with a new device
it will miss out on the benefits of creating a proper interface for the
Master Driver Agent.

Creating an Interface for a device allows users of the device to automatically benefit
from the following platform features:

- Existing Agents can interact with the device via the Actuator Agent without any code changes.
- Configuration follows the standard form of other devices. Existing and future tools
    for configuring devices on the platform will work with the new device driver.
- Historians will automatically capture data published by the new device driver.
- Device data can be graphed in VOLTTRON Central in real time.
- If the device can receive a heartbeat signal the driver framework can be configured to
   automatically send a heartbeat signal.

- When the configuration store feature is rolled out the device can by dynamically configured
   through the platform.

Creating a New Interface
------------------------

To create a new device driver create a new module in the
:py:mod:`MasterDriverAgent.master_driver.interfaces` package. The name of
this module will be the name to use in the "driver_type" setting in
a :ref:`driver configuration file <driver-configuration-file>` in order to
load the new driver.

In the new module create a subclass of :py:class:`BaseInterface` called `Interface`.

The `Interface` class must implement the following methods:

- :py:meth:`BaseInterface.configure`
- :py:meth:`BaseInterface.set_point`
- :py:meth:`BaseInterface.get_point`
- :py:meth:`BaseInterface.scrape_all`


These methods are required but can be implemented using the :py:class:`BasicRevert` mixin.

- :py:meth:`BaseInterface.revert_point`
- :py:meth:`BaseInterface.revert_all`

Each point on the device must be represented by an instance of the
:py:class:`BaseInterface`. Create one or more subclasses of :py:class:`BaseInterface`
as needed to represent the points on a device.


Interface Configuration and Startup
-----------------------------------

When processing a :ref:`driver configuration file <driver-configuration-file>`
the Master Driver Agent will use the "driver_type" setting to automatically find and load the
appropriate ``Interface`` class for the desired driver.

After loading the class the Master Driver Agent will call :py:meth:`BaseInterface.configure`
with the contents of the "driver_config" section of the
:ref:`driver configuration file <driver-configuration-file>`
parsed into a python dictionary and the contents of the file referenced in
"registry_config" entry.

:py:meth:`BaseInterface.configure` must setup register representations of all points
on a device by creating instances of :py:class:`BaseRegister` (or a subclass) and adding them
to the Interface with :py:meth:`BaseInterface.insert_register`.

After calling :py:meth:`BaseInterface.configure` the Master Driver Agent
will use the created registers to create meta data for each point on the device.

Device Scraping
---------------

The work scheduling and publish periodic device scrapes is handled by
the Master Driver Agent. When a scrape starts the Master Driver Agent calls the
:py:meth:`BaseInterface.scrape_all`. It will take the results of the
call and attach meta data and and publish as needed.

Device Interaction
------------------

Requests to interact with the device via any method supported by the platform
are routed to the correct Interface instance by the Master Driver Agent.

Most commands originate from RPC calls to the
:py:class:`Actuator Agent<ActuatorAgent.actuator.agent>` and are forwarded
to the Master Driver Agent.

- A command to set the value of a point on a device results in a call to
    :py:meth:`BaseInterface.set_point`.

- A request for the current value of a point on a device results in a call to
    :py:meth:`BaseInterface.get_point`.

- A request to revert a point on a device to its default state results in a call to
    :py:meth:`BaseInterface.revert_point`.

- A request to revert an entire device to its default state results in a call to
    :py:meth:`BaseInterface.revert_all`.


Registers
---------

The Master Driver Agent uses the :py:meth:`BaseInterface.get_register_names` and
:py:meth:`BaseInterface.get_register_by_name` methods to get registers to setup meta data.

This means that its a requirement to use the BaseRegister class to store
information about points on a devices.


Using the BasicRevert Mixin
---------------------------

If the device protocol has no support for reverting to a default state an `Interface`
this functionality can be implemented with the :py:class:`BasicRevert` mixin.

When using the :py:class:`BasicRevert` mixin you must specify it first in the list
of parent classes, otherwise it won't Python won't detect that the
:py:meth:`BaseInterface.revert_point` and :py:meth:`BaseInterface.revert_all` have
been implemented.

If desired the :py:meth:`BasicRevert.set_default` can be used by the `Interface` class
to set values for each point to revert to.

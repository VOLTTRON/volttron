## Lines start with ## are ignored by parser as comments. Parser also ignore
## empty lines
## Format for this file
## --------------------
## Each category name should be in a separate line and should be prefixed and
## suffixed with a single #. Example #Site#. Tags should be listed immediately
## below the category name line. Tags can be placed one per line or multiple
## tags can be separated by a space character and placed in the same line.
## tags can optionally have a description. Tag and description should be
## separated by a : character. Anything after a : in a line is ignored by the
## parser. This format make it easy to copy paste tags from haystack site.
## This file if exists within the resources directory of the package, gets
## loaded at the time of tagging service init

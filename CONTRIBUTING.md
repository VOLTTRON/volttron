# Contributing

Thank you for wanting to contribute back to Volttron! We really appreciate it.

We have a lengthy [Guide to Contributions](https://volttron.readthedocs.io/en/develop/community_resources/contributing.html) on our ReadTheDocs site, where all of our documentation lives. This guide focuses on helpful instructions for newcomers to GitHub and Git.

### Branch Naming

We use `develop` as the active development branch, and not `master`. Please submit PRs to `develop` by default.

### Testing

Most platform code tests exist in the `volttrontesting/` directory, and agents are expected to contain tests. We look to continue to improve our tests as the project evolves as well! Contributors should follow the examples in the various agent directories, for now.

### Linting and docs

You do not need to lint your Python code. But try and follow the general style used elsewhere.

You do not need to build documentation changes when submitting doc fixes.

### Improving this doc

Suggestions for what we should add here or on ReadTheDocs are welcome.

Thank you.

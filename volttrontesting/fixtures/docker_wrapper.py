        This is a wrapper around the docker api documented at https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/containers.html.
        Some things that this will do automatically for the caller is make the container be ephemeral by removing it
        once the context manager is cleaned up.

        This function is being used for long running processes.  Short processes may not work correctly because
        the execution time might be too short for the returning of data from the container.

        Usage:

            with create_container("mysql", {"3306/tcp": 3306}):
                # connect to localhost:3306 with mysql using connector

        :param ports:
            a dictionary following the convention {'portincontainer/protocol': portonhost}

            ::
                # example port exposing mysql's known port.
                {'3306/tcp': 3306}
        :param env: environment variables to set inside the container.
        :param command: string or list of commands to run during the startup of the container.
        :param startup_time_seconds: Allow this many seconds for the startup of the container before raising a
            runtime exception (Download of image and instantiation could take a while)

volttron.lint -- a pylint plugin to mask spurious dynamic attribute errors.

volttron.lint is a pylint plugin to mask spurious errors produced by pylint
when objects with dynamic attributes are used. Dynamic attributes are those not
defined directly on the object but are instead added by a metaclass or through
calls to __getattribute__(). This module allows adding fake modules/classes
which are added to the lookup mechanism to allow pylint to properly check
dynamic attributes.

Each fake module should be contained in a file in this directory named the same
as the module it fakes plus a '.py' extension. Upon loading the plugin, a
module transform function will be registered which will read the module file,
if it exists, and create and add the appropriate objects and attributes to the
namespace for that class. See the existing files for details.

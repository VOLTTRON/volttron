class TopicFormatter(Formatter):
    '''Format topic strings allowing for optional fields.

    TopicFormatter.format() works similar to the standard str.format()
    built-in, except that format strings may contain double forward
    slashes (//) to indicate break points in the string where a valid
    string may be returned if no replaceable fields occur in the
    following component.  A format field may optionally be passed
    through unsubstituted by passing a value of None for that field.

    Normal formatter processing splits the format string into a stream
    of string platformrals and replacement fields.  The replacement fields
    are replaced by values passed in via the positional and keyword
    arguments and are converted and formatted according to the field
    format before being substituted in the token stream.  Finally, the
    stream is concatenated and returned.  The first replacement field
    missing a value in the provided arguments stops processing and an
    exception is raised.  The topic formatter follows the same behavior
    except that instead of raising an exception, the previous platformral is
    truncated at the final double slash (//), and all the processed
    components are concatenated and the result returned.

    Another addition is the optional conversion specifiers. These are
    the standard conversion specifiers 's' and 'r', but upper-cased as
    'S' or 'R'.  When one of these conversion specifiers is given, the
    component will be skipped if a value is not provided for that field.

    See the Formatter documentation for the built-in string module for
    more information on formatters and the role of each method.

def schedule(cron_string, start=None, stop=None):
    '''Return a schedule generator from a cron-style string.

    cron_string is a cron-style time expression consisting of five
    whitespace-separated fields explained in further detail below.
    start and stop are used to bound the schedule and can be None,
    datetime.datetime objects or numeric values, such as is returned by
    time.time().  stop may also be supplied as a datetime.timedelta
    object, in which case the end time is start + stop.  If start is
    None, the current time is used.  If stop is None, schedule will
    generate values infinitely.  Each iteration yields a
    datetime.datetime object.

    The following description of the cron fields is taken from the
    crontab(5) man page (with slight modifications).

    The time and date fields are:

           field          allowed values
           -----          --------------
           minute         0-59
           hour           0-23
           day of month   1-31
           month          1-12 (or names, see below)
           day of week    0-7 (0 or 7 is Sunday, or use names)

    A field may contain an asterisk (*), which always stands for
    "first-last".

    Ranges of numbers are allowed.  Ranges are two numbers separated
    with a hyphen.  The specified range is inclusive.  For example, 8-11
    for an 'hours' entry specifies execution at hours 8, 9, 10, and 11.
    If the range start or end value is left off, the first or last value
    will be used.  For example, -8 for an 'hours' entry is equivalent to
    0-8, 20- for a 'days of month' entry is equivalent to 20-31, and -
    for a 'months' entry is equivalent to 1-12.

    Lists are allowed.  A list is a set of numbers (or ranges) separated
    by commas.  Examples: "1,2,5,9", "0-4,8-12".

    Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges.  Following a
    range with "/<number>" specifies skips of the number's value through
    the range.  For example, "0-23/2" can be used in the 'hours' field
    to specify every other hour.  Step values are also permitted after
    an asterisk, "*/2" in the 'hours' field is equivalent to "0-23/2".

    Names can also be used for the 'month' and 'day of week' fields.
    Use at least the first three letters of the particular day or month
    (case does not matter).

    Note: The day can be specified in the following two fields: 'day of
    month', and 'day of week'.  If both fields are restricted (i.e., do
    not contain the "*" character), then both are used to compute
    date/time values.  For example, "30 4 1,15 * 5" is interpreted as
    "4:30 am on the 1st and 15th of each month, plus every Friday."

    This class implements a descriptor that works similar to the
    classmethod() built-ins and can be used as a decorator, like the
    property() built-in. Instead of a method being only a class or
    instance method, two methods can share the same name and be accessed
    as an instance method or a class method based on the context.

    Example:

    >>> class Foo(object):
    ...     @dualmethod
    ...     def bar(self):
    ...         print 'instance method for', self
    ...     @bar.classmethod
    ...     def bar(cls):
    ...         print 'class method for', cls
    ...
    >>> Foo.bar()
    class method for <class '__main__.Foo'>
    >>> Foo().bar()
    instance method for <__main__.Foo object at 0x7fcd744f6610>

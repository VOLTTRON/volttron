    '''VOLTTRON 2.x compatible agent pub/sub message exchange bus.

    Accept multi-part messages from sockets connected to in_addr, which
    is a PULL socket, and forward them to sockets connected to out_addr,
    which is a XPUB socket. When subscriptions are added or removed, a
    message of the form 'subscriptions/<OP>/<TOPIC>' is broadcast to the
    PUB socket where <OP> is either 'add' or 'remove' and <TOPIC> is the
    topic being subscribed or unsubscribed. When a message is received
    of the form 'subscriptions/list/<PREFIX>', a multipart message will
    be broadcast with the first two received frames (topic and headers)
    sent unchanged and with the remainder of the message containing
    currently subscribed topics which start with <PREFIX>, each frame
    containing exactly one topic.

"""VIP - VOLTTRONâ„¢ Interconnect Protocol implementation

See https://volttron.readthedocs.io/en/develop/core_services/messagebus/VIP/VIP-Overview.html
for protocol specification.

This module is useful for using VIP outside of gevent. Please understand
that ZeroMQ sockets are not thread-safe and care must be used when using
across threads (or avoided all together). There is no locking around the
state as there is with the gevent version in the green sub-module.

'''VIP - VOLTTRONâ„¢ Interconnect Protocol implementation

See https://github.com/VOLTTRON/volttron/wiki/VIP for protocol
specification.

This module is for use within gevent. It provides some locking around
send operations to protect the VIP state. It should be safe to use a
single socket in multiple greenlets without any kind of locking.

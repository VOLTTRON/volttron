'''Resource Monitor

The resource monitor manages resources assigned to the platform, assigns
resources to agent execution environments, and monitors those resources
for abuse.

There will typically be only a single resource monitor that is
instantiated and then set using set_resource_monitor().  Other modules
may then just import the module and call the module-level functions
without worrying about where to find the monitor instance.

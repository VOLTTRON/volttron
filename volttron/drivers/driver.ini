#Maximum APDU legnth accepted
# (From bacpypes documentation)
# BACnet works on lots of different types of networks, from high speed Ethernet to “slower” 
#  and “cheaper” ARCNET or MS/TP (a serial bus protocol used for a field bus defined by BACnet). 
#  For devices to exchange messages they have to know the maximum size message the device can handle.

#This setting determines the largest APDU accepted by the smap BACnet virtual device.
#Valid options are 50, 128, 206, 480, 1024, and 1476
#Defaults to 1024
#max_apdu_length = 1024

#Segmentation
# (From bacpypes documentation)
#  A vast majority of BACnet communications traffic fits in one message, but there can be 
#  times when larger messages are convinient and more efficient. Segmentation allows larger 
#  messages to be broken up into segemnts and spliced back together. It is not unusual for 
#  “low power” field equipment to not support segmentation.

#Possible setting are segmentedBoth (default), segmentedTransmit, segmentedReceive, or noSegmentation
#segmented_supported = segmentedBoth

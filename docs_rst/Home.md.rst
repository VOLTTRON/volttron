VOLTTRON is an open source agent development and deployment platform
designed to enable researchers to interact with devices and appliances
without having to write drivers themselves. Please explore our project
and if you have any questions please email volttron@pnnl.gov. More
information about VOLTTRON can be found at:
http://transactionalnetwork.pnnl.gov/

The main features of the VOLTTRON platform are:

-  Open, flexible and modular software platform
-  Ease of application development
-  Interoperable across vendors and applications
-  Isolates power and control system complexities from developers
-  Object oriented, modern software development environment
-  Language agnostic. Does not tie the applications to a specific
   language such as Java
-  Broad device and control systems protocols support built-in
-  ModBUS, BACNet, and others
-  Multiple types of controllers and sensors
-  Low CPU, memory and storage footprint requirements
-  Supports non-Intel CPUs

New to VOLTTRON?

VOLTTRON Based Applications
---------------------------

Applications can be built upon VOLTTRON by extended its capabilities. An
example of this is the `BeMOSS <http://www.bemoss.org/>`__ system
developed by Virginia Tech. This application adds auto-discovery
capability for several devices as well as a user interface for
controlling those devices. These features build on the core of VOLTTRON.

Data Model Standards
====================

Interoperability within Volttron - and generally - requires a common
language for entities to communicate. LBNL is conducting research to
make recommendations for specific items that Volttron agents may
communicate about. The initial focus of this work is:

-  Sensors: Type, units, etc.
-  Identification: Brand, Model, Classification, unique ID, etc.
-  Location: Where in building

A link to a document of recommendations will be added to this page when
ready.

The INI style file supplied necessary parameters to the parser. The INI file here is an example to 
extract a handful of functions for the TEMPCO Modbus device. The address map file is also provided.

Executing the Python script with the tempco_device.ini file and the tempco_address_map.csv produces 
the mdl_map.xml.

The mdl_map.xml can then be used in the driver code generator.

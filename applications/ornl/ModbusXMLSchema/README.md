Modbus XML Schema Definition and utility software

This project creates the eXtended Markup Language (XML) Schema definition (XSD) for interoperability of Modbus devices 
using a common and expressive set of XML elements to describe their input and output functions. The goal of the proposed 
technology is to facilitate the rapid, cost-effective retrofit integration of building automation systems by exposing the 
functions of sensors, actuators, and other data sources through a uniform software interface.

This script watches a temp file for volttron_home to change.  When it changes, this
script will attempt to connect and execute peerlist on the platform after every
10th of a second.

Execute the following in an activated shell:

    python debugging_utils/peerlist-watcher.py

In another shell echo the volttron home to the proper file.

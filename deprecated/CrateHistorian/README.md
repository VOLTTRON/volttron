# Crate Historian

Crate is an open source SQL database designed on top of a No-SQL design.
It allows automatic data replication and self-healing clusters for high
availability, automatic sharding, and fast joins, aggregations and
sub-selects.

Find out more about crate from <https://crate.io/>.

# Upgrading

As of version 3 of the CrateHistorian the default topics table is topics
instead of topic. To continue using the same table name for topics
please add a tabledef section to your configuration file

``` {.python}
{
    "connection": {
        "type": "crate",
        # Optional table prefix defaults to historian
        "schema": "testing",
        "params": {
            "host": "localhost:4200"
        }
    },
    "tables_def": {
        "table_prefix": "",
        "data_table": "data",
        "topics_table": "topics",
        "meta_table": "meta"
    }
}
```

> **_NOTE:_** 
CrateHistorian is still alpha, schemas could change in the future, do
not use this for production data until schema is confirmed as final
Currently the historian supports two schemas for numerical data, the
primary schema closely resembles the SQLHistorian schema but there is an
optional \"raw\" schema that can be enabled in the config below that
utilizes some of the advanced indexing features of crate

# Prerequisites

## 1. Crate Database

Install crate version 3.3.3 from
<https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/releases/crate-3.3.3.tar.gz>. Untar the
file and run crate-3.3.3/bin/crate to start crate. After the
installation the service will be available for viewing at
<http://localhost:4200> by default.

> **_NOTE:_** 
Authentication for crate is an enterprise subscription only feature.


## 2. Crate Driver

There is a python library for crate that must be installed in the
volttron python environment in order to access crate. From an activated
environment, in the root of the volttron folder, execute the following
command:

>     python bootstrap.py --crate

or

>     pip install crate

# Configuration

The following is an example of the crate historian\'s configuration.

``` {.python}
{
    "connection": {
        "type": "crate",
        # Optional table prefix defaults to historian
        "schema": "testing",
        "params": {
            "host": "localhost:4200"
        }
    }
}
```

The VOLTTRON team has made an sMAP test server available to simplify
getting started with the platform. This server can be used to fill out
the sMAP driver file detailed at [[ControllerAccess]].

The server is located at: ``smap-test.cloudapp.net``. The sMAP driver
and any agent configs can be setup to run against this server using a
public sMAP key: ``LEq1cEGc04RtcKX6riiX7eaML8Z82xEgQrp7``

Server Intended for Testing Only

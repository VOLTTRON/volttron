Service will interact with the message bus through three topics.

-  Request - The service agent will listen to incoming requests on this
   topic
-  Response - The service agent will respond on this topic
-  Error - The service will "throw" errors on this topic

Agents which are using these services agents should publish to the above
Request topic and listen on the Reponse and Error topics. Response and
Errors will retain the header that was sent into the request.

.. _Multi-Platform-Multi-Bus:

========================
Multi-Platform Multi-Bus
========================

This guide describes the setup process for a multi-platform connection that has a combination of :term:`ZeroMQ` and
:term:`RabbitMQ` instances.  For this example, we want to use the Forwarder to pass device data from two VOLTTRON
instance to a single "central" instance for storage.  It will also have a Volttron Central agent running on the
"central" instance and Volttron Central Platform agents on all 3 instances and connected to "central" instance to
provide operational status of it's instance to the "central" instance. For this document "node" will be used
interchangeably with VOLTTRON instance. The authentication of remote connections can be performed either using 
admin web interface or using command line interface. We will demonstrate both the approaches.

Node Setup
----------

For this example we will have two types of nodes; a data collector and a central node.  Each of the data collectors will
have different message buses (VOLTTRON supports both RabbitMQ and ZeroMQ). The nodes will be configured as in the
following table.

.. csv-table:: Node Configuration
   :header: "", "Central", "Node-ZMQ", "Node-RMQ"
   :widths: 20, 15, 10, 10

   "Node Type", "Central", "Data Collector", "Data Collector"
   "Platform Driver", "", "yes", "yes"
   "Forwarder", "", "yes", "yes"
   "SQL Historian", "yes", "", ""
   "Volttron Central", "yes", "", ""
   "Volttron Central Platform", "yes", "yes", "yes"
   "Exposes RMQ Port", "yes", "", ""
   "Exposes ZMQ Port", "yes", "", ""
   "Exposes HTTPS Port", "yes", "", ""

The goal of this is to be able to see the data from Node-ZMQ and Node-RMQ in the Central SQL Historian and on
the trending charts of Volttron Central.


Virtual Machine Setup
---------------------

The first step in creating a VOLTTRON instance is to make sure the machine is ready for VOLTTRON.  Each machine
should have its hostname setup.  For this walk-through, the hostnames "central", "node-zmq" and "node-rmq" will be used.

For Central and Node-RMQ follow the instructions :ref:`platform installation steps for RMQ <RabbitMQ-Install>`.  For
Node-ZMQ use :ref:`Platform Installation steps for ZeroMQ <ZeroMQ-Install>`.


Instance Setup
--------------

The following conventions/assumptions are made for the rest of this document:

  - Commands should be run from the VOLTTRON root
  - Default values are used for VOLTTRON_HOME($HOME/.volttron), :term:`VIP` port (22916), HTTPS port (8443), RabbitMQ
    ports (5671 for AMQPs and 15671 for RabbitMQ management interface).  If using different :term:`VOLTTRON_HOME` or
    ports, please replace accordingly.
  - Replace central, node-zmq and node-rmq with your own hostnames.
  - user will represent your current user.

The following will use `vcfg` (volttron-cfg) to configure the individual platforms.


Central Instance Setup
----------------------

.. note::

  This instance must have been bootstrapped using ``--rabbitmq`` see
  :ref:`RabbitMq installation instructions <RabbitMQ-Install>`.

Next step would be to configure the instance to have a web interface to accept/deny incoming certificate signing
requests from other instances. Additionally, we will need to install a Volttron Central agent, Volttron Central
Platform agent, SQL historian agent and a Listener agent. The following shows an example command output for this setup.

.. code-block:: console

    You can now start the volttron instance.

    If you need to change the instance configuration you can edit
    the config file is at /home/user/.volttron/config


Start VOLTTRON instance and check if the agents are installed.

.. code-block:: console

  ./start-volttron
  vctl status

Using the web interface:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open browser and go to the platform web admin authentication page `https://central:8443/index.html` to accept/reject
incoming certificate signing request (CSR) from other platforms.

.. note::

  Replace "central" with the proper hostname of VC instance in the admin page URL. If opening the admin page from a
  different system, then please make that the hostname is resolvable in that machine.

Click on "Login To Administration Area".

.. image:: files/csr-initial-state.png

Set the platform web admin username and password. This can be later used to login into the web admin
authentication page.  This username and password will also be used to log in to Volttron Central.

.. image:: files/csr-set-admin.png

Login into the platform web admin page.

.. image:: files/csr-login-page.png

After logging in, you will see no CSR requests initially.

.. image:: files/central_no_pending.png

Go back to the terminal and start Volttron Central Platform agent on the "central" instance. The agent will send a CSR
request to the web interface.

.. code-block:: console

  vctl start --tag vcp

Now go to the platform web admin page to check if there is a new pending CSR request. You will see a "PENDING" request
from "central.central.platform.agent"

.. image:: files/central_pending.png

Approve the CSR request to allow authenticated SSL based connection to the "central" instance.

Go back to the terminal and check the status of Volttron Central Platform agent. It should be set to "GOOD".

Using command line:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternatively, you can also check the status of pending CSRs via the command line.

After starting the Volttron Central Platform agent,
use the auth remote sub-command's ``list`` to display the current pending certs.

.. code-block:: console

    vctl auth remote list

You will see the pending CSR appear in the list.

.. code-block:: console

    USER_ID                              ADDRESS        STATUS
    central.central.platform.agent       192.168.56.101 PENDING

Approve the pending CSR using the ``approve`` command.

.. code-block:: console

    vctl auth remote approve central.central.platform.agent

Run the ``list`` command again to verify that the CSR has been approved.

.. code-block:: console

    USER_ID                              ADDRESS        STATUS
    central.central.platform.agent       192.168.56.101 APPROVED

Node-ZMQ Instance Setup
-----------------------
On the "node-zmq" VM, setup a ZeroMQ based VOLTTRON instance. Using "vcfg" command, install Volttron Central Platform agent,
a platform driver agent with a fake driver.

.. note::

  This instance will use old ZeroMQ based authentication mechanism using CURVE keys.

.. code:: console

    (volttron)user@node-zmq:~/volttron$ vcfg

    Your VOLTTRON_HOME currently set to: /home/user/.volttron

    Is this the volttron you are attempting to setup? [Y]:
    What type of message bus (rmq/zmq)? [zmq]:
    What is the vip address? [tcp://127.0.0.1]:
    What is the port for the vip address? [22916]:
    Is this instance web enabled? [N]:
    Will this instance be controlled by volttron central? [Y]:

    What is the port for volttron central? [8080]: 8443
    ['volttron', '-vv', '-l', '/home/user/.volttron/volttron.cfg.log']
    Should the agent autostart? [N]:
    Would you like to install a platform historian? [N]:
    Would you like to install a platform driver? [N]: y
    Configuring /home/user/volttron/services/core/PlatformDriverAgent.
    ['volttron', '-vv', '-l', '/home/user/.volttron/volttron.cfg.log']
    Would you like to install a fake device on the platform driver? [N]: y
    Should the agent autostart? [N]: y
    Would you like to install a listener agent? [N]:
    Finished configuration!

    You can now start the volttron instance.

    If you need to change the instance configuration you can edit
    the config file is at /home/user/.volttron/config


Please note the Volttron Central web-address should point to that of the "central" instance.

Start VOLTTRON instance and check if the agents are installed.

.. code-block:: console

  ./start-volttron
  vctl status

Start Volttron Central Platform on this platform manually.

.. code-block:: console

  vctl start --tag vcp

Check the VOLTTRON log in the "central" instance, you will see "authentication failure" entry from the incoming
connection. You will need to add the public key of VCP agent on the "central" instance.

.. image:: files/vc-auth-failure.png


At this point, you can either accept the connection through the admin page or the command line.

Using the admin page:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Navigate back to the platform web admin authentication page. You should see a pending request under the ZMQ Keys Pending
Authorization header.

.. image:: files/zmq_pending_credential_1.png

Accept the credential in the same method as a CSR.


Using the command line:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As with the pending CSR, list the current pending certs and credentials.

.. code-block:: console

    vctl auth remote list

You will see the pending ZMQ credential has been added to the list.

.. code-block:: console

    USER_ID                              ADDRESS        STATUS
    central.central.platform.agent       192.168.56.101 APPROVED
    68ef33c4-97bc-4e1b-b5f6-2a6049993b65 127.0.0.1      PENDING

Approve the pending ZMQ credential using the ``approve`` command.

.. code-block:: console

    vctl auth remote approve 68ef33c4-97bc-4e1b-b5f6-2a6049993b65

Run the ``list`` command again to verify that the credential has been approved.

.. code-block:: console

    USER_ID                              ADDRESS        STATUS
    central.central.platform.agent       192.168.56.101 APPROVED
    68ef33c4-97bc-4e1b-b5f6-2a6049993b65 127.0.0.1      APPROVED


Complete similar steps to start a forwarder agent that connects to "central" instance. Modify the configuration in
`services/core/ForwardHistorian/rmq_config.yml` to have a destination :term:`VIP address` pointing to VIP address of the
"central" instance and server key of the "central" instance.

.. code-block:: yaml

  ---
  destination-vip: tcp://<ip>:22916
  destination-serverkey: <serverkey>

.. note::

  Replace <ip> with public facing IP-address of "central" instance and <serverkey> with serverkey of "central"
  instance.
  Use the command **vctl auth serverkey** on the "central" instance to get the server key of the instance

Install and start forwarder agent.

.. code-block:: console

  python scripts/install-agent.py -s services/core/ForwardHistorian -c services/core/ForwardHistorian/rmq_config.yml --start


Using the admin page:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To accept the credential, navigate back to the platform web admin authentication page. You should see another pending request under the ZMQ Keys
Pending Authorization header.

.. image:: files/zmq_pending_credential_2.png

Accept this credential in the same method as before.


Using the command line:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To accept the credential via the command line,

.. code-block:: console

    vctl auth remote list

You will see the pending ZMQ credential has been added to the list.

.. code-block:: console

    USER_ID                              ADDRESS        STATUS
    central.central.platform.agent       192.168.56.101 APPROVED
    68ef33c4-97bc-4e1b-b5f6-2a6049993b65 127.0.0.1      APPROVED
    fb30249d-b267-4bdd-b29a-d9112e6a6082 127.0.0.1      PENDING

Approve the pending ZMQ credential using the ``approve`` command.

.. code-block:: console

    vctl auth remote approve fb30249d-b267-4bdd-b29a-d9112e6a6082

Run the ``list`` command again to verify that the credential has been approved.

.. code-block:: console

    USER_ID                              ADDRESS        STATUS
    central.central.platform.agent       192.168.56.101 APPROVED
    68ef33c4-97bc-4e1b-b5f6-2a6049993b65 127.0.0.1      APPROVED
    fb30249d-b267-4bdd-b29a-d9112e6a6082 127.0.0.1      APPROVED


In either case, you should start seeing messages from "collector1" instance on the "central" instance's VOLTTRON log now.

.. image:: files/vc-collector1-forwarder.png


Node-RMQ Instance Setup
-----------------------

.. note::

  This instance must have been bootstrapped using --rabbitmq see
  :ref:`RabbitMq installation instructions <RabbitMQ-Install>`.


Using "vcfg" command, install Volttron Central Platform agent, a platform driver agent with fake driver. The instance

.. note::

 The Volttron Central web-address should point to that of the "central" instance.

Start VOLTTRON instance and check if the agents are installed.

.. code-block:: console

  ./start-volttron
  vctl status

Start Volttron Central Platform on this platform manually.

.. code-block:: console

  vctl start --tag vcp

Accept the pending CSR request.

Using the admin page:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go the master admin authentication page and check if there is a new pending CSR request from VCP agent of "collector2"
instance.

.. image:: files/remote_rmq_pending.png

Approve the CSR request to allow authenticated SSL based connection to the "central" instance.


Using the command line:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As before, this can be done via the command line as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    vctl auth remote list

.. code-block:: console

    USER_ID                                 ADDRESS        STATUS

Now go back to the terminal and check the status of Volttron Central Platform agent. It should be set to "GOOD".


Let's now install a forwarder agent on this instance to forward local messages matching "devices" topic to external
"central" instance. Modify the configuration in `services/core/ForwardHistorian/rmq_config.yml` to have a destination
address pointing to web address of the "central" instance.

.. code-block:: yaml

Office Hours
^^^^^^^^^^^^

PNNL hosts office hours every other week on Fridays at 11 AM (PST).
These meetings are designed to be very informal where VOLTTRON
developers can answer specific questions about the inner workings of
VOLTTRON. These meetings are also available for topical discussions of
different aspects of the VOLTTRON platform. Currently the office hours
are available through a Lync meeting.

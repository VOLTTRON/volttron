Data Publisher
==============

This is a simple agent that plays back data either from the config store or a CSV to the configured topic.  It can also
provide basic emulation of the Actuator Agent for testing agents that expect to be able to set points on a device in
response to device publishes.


Installation notes
------------------

In order to simulate the actuator you must install the agent with the :term:`VIP Identity` of `platform.actuator`.  If
an an actuator is already installed on the platform, this will cause VIP identity conflicts.  To install the
agent, the agent install script can be used:

.. code-block:: bash

    python scripts/install-agent.py -s examples/DataPublisher -c <config file>


Configuration
-------------

::

    {
        # basetopic can be devices, analysis, or custom base topic
        "basepath": "devices/PNNL/ISB1",

        # use_timestamp uses the included in the input_data if present.
        # Currently the column must be named `Timestamp`.
        "use_timestamp": true,

        # Only publish data at most once every max_data_frequency seconds.
        # Extra data is skipped.
        # The time windows are normalized from midnight.
        # ie 900 will publish one value for every 15 minute window starting from
        # midnight of when the agent was started.
        # Only used if timestamp in input file is used.
        "max_data_frequency": 900,

        # The meta data published with the device data is generated
        # by matching point names to the unittype_map.
        "unittype_map": {
            ".*Temperature": "Farenheit",
            ".*SetPoint": "Farenheit",
            "OutdoorDamperSignal": "On/Off",
            "SupplyFanStatus": "On/Off",
            "CoolingCall": "On/Off",
            "SupplyFanSpeed": "RPM",
            "Damper*.": "On/Off",
            "Heating*.": "On/Off",
            "DuctStatic*.": "On/Off"
        },
        # Path to input CSV file.
        # May also be a list of records or reference to a CSV file in the config store.
        # Large CSV files should be referenced by file name and not
        # stored in the config store.
        "input_data": "econ_test2.csv",
        # Publish interval in seconds
        "publish_interval": 1,

        # Tell the playback to maintain the location a the file in the config store.
        # Playback will be resumed from this point
        # at agent startup even if this setting is changed to false before restarting.
        # Saves the current line in line_marker in the DataPublishers's config store
        # as plain text.
        # default false
        "remember_playback": true,

        # Start playback from 0 even if the line_marker configuration is set a non 0 value.
        # default false
        "reset_playback": false,

        # Repeat data from the start if this flag is true.
        # Useful for data that does not include a timestamp and is played back in real time.
        "replay_data": false
    }


CSV File Format
---------------

The CSV file must have a single header line.  The column names are appended to the `basepath` setting in the
configuration file and the resulting topic is normalized to remove extra` ``/`` characters.  The values are all treated
as floating point values and converted accordingly.

The corresponding device for each point is determined and the values are combined together to create an `all` topic
publish for each device.

If a `Timestamp` column is in the input it may be used to set the timestamp in the header of the published data.

.. csv-table:: Publisher Data
        :header: Timestamp,centrifugal_chiller/OutsideAirTemperature,centrifugal_chiller/DischargeAirTemperatureSetPoint,fuel_cell/DischargeAirTemperature,fuel_cell/CompressorStatus,absorption_chiller/SupplyFanSpeed,absorption_chiller/SupplyFanStatus,boiler/DuctStaticPressureSetPoint,boiler/DuctStaticPressure

Agent Development
=================

The VOLTTRON platform now has utilities to speed the creation and installation of new agents. To use these utilities the
VOLTTRON environment must be activated.

From the project directory, activate the VOLTTRON environment with:

.. code-block:: bash

    source env/bin/activate


Create Agent Code
=================

Run the following command to start the Agent Creation Wizard:

.. code-block:: bash

    vpkg init TestAgent tester

`TestAgent` is the directory that the agent code will be placed in. The directory must not exist when the command is
run.  `tester` is the name of the agent module created by wizard.

The Wizard will prompt for the following information:

.. code-block:: console

    Agent version number: [0.1]: 0.5
    Agent author: []: VOLTTRON Team
    Author's email address: []: volttron@pnnl.gov
    Agent homepage: []: https://volttron.org/
    Short description of the agent: []: Agent development tutorial.

Once the last question is answered the following will print to the console:

.. code-block:: console

    2018-08-02 12:20:56,604 () volttron.platform.packaging INFO: Creating TestAgent

    2018-08-02 12:20:56,604 () volttron.platform.packaging INFO: Creating TestAgent/tester/__init__.py

The TestAgent directory is created with the new Agent inside.


Agent Directory
===============

At this point, the contents of the TestAgent directory should look like:

::

    TestAgent/
    ├── setup.py
    ├── config
    └── tester
        ├── agent.py
        └── __init__.py


Examine the Agent Code
----------------------

The resulting code is well documented with comments and documentation strings. It gives examples of how to do common
tasks in VOLTTRON Agents (refer to the :ref:`Agent Development Cheatsheet <Agent-Development-Cheatsheet>` for more
information).  The main agent code is found in `tester/agent.py`.


Parse Packaged Configuration and Create Agent Instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The code to parse a configuration file packaged and installed with the agent is found in the `tester` function:

.. code-block:: python

    def tester(config_path, **kwargs):
        """Parses the Agent configuration and returns an instance of
        the agent created using that configuration.

        :param config_path: Path to a configuration file.

        :type config_path: str
        :returns: Tester
        :rtype: Tester
        """
        try:
            config = utils.load_config(config_path)
        except StandardError:
            config = {}

        if not config:
            _log.info("Using Agent defaults for starting configuration.")

        setting1 = int(config.get('setting1', 1))
        setting2 = config.get('setting2', "some/random/topic")

        return Tester(setting1,
                      setting2,
                      **kwargs)

The configuration is parsed with the `utils.load_config` function and the results are stored in the `config` variable.
An instance of the Agent is created from the parsed values and is returned.


Initialization and Configuration Store Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :ref:`configuration store <Agent-Configuration-Store-Interface>` is a powerful feature.  The agent template provides
a simple example of setting up default configuration store values and setting up a configuration handler.

.. code-block:: python

    class Tester(Agent):
        """
        Document agent constructor here.
        """

        def __init__(self, setting1=1, setting2="some/random/topic",
                     **kwargs):
            super(Tester, self).__init__(**kwargs)
            _log.debug("vip_identity: " + self.core.identity)

            self.setting1 = setting1
            self.setting2 = setting2

            self.default_config = {"setting1": setting1,
                                   "setting2": setting2}


            #Set a default configuration to ensure that self.configure is called immediately to setup
            #the agent.
            self.vip.config.set_default("config", self.default_config)
            #Hook self.configure up to changes to the configuration file "config".
            self.vip.config.subscribe(self.configure, actions=["NEW", "UPDATE"], pattern="config")

        def configure(self, config_name, action, contents):
            """
            Called after the Agent has connected to the message bus. If a configuration exists at startup
            this will be called before onstart.

            Is called every time the configuration in the store changes.
            """
            config = self.default_config.copy()
            config.update(contents)

            _log.debug("Configuring Agent")

            try:
                setting1 = int(config["setting1"])
                setting2 = str(config["setting2"])
            except ValueError as e:
                _log.error("ERROR PROCESSING CONFIGURATION: {}".format(e))
                return

            self.setting1 = setting1
            self.setting2 = setting2

            self._create_subscriptions(self.setting2)

Values in the default config can be built into the agent or come from the packaged configuration file. The subscribe
method tells our agent which function to call whenever there is a new or updated config file. For more information
on using the configuration store see :ref:`Agent Configuration Store <Agent-Configuration-Store-Interface>`.

`_create_subscriptions` (covered in the next section) will use the value in `self.setting2` to create a new subscription.


Setting up a Subscription
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Agent creates a subscription to a topic on the message bus using the value of `self.setting2` in the method
`_create_subscription`. The messages for this subscription are handled with the `_handle_publish` method:

.. code-block:: python

        def _create_subscriptions(self, topic):
            #Unsubscribe from everything.
            self.vip.pubsub.unsubscribe("pubsub", None, None)

            self.vip.pubsub.subscribe(peer='pubsub',
                                      prefix=topic,
                                      callback=self._handle_publish)

        def _handle_publish(self, peer, sender, bus, topic, headers,
                                    message):
            #By default no action is taken.
            pass


Agent Lifecycle Events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Methods may be setup to be called at agent startup and shutdown:

.. code-block:: python

        @Core.receiver("onstart")
        def onstart(self, sender, **kwargs):
            """
            This method is called once the Agent has successfully connected to the platform.
            This is a good place to setup subscriptions if they are not dynamic or to
            do any other startup activities that require a connection to the message bus.
            Called after any configurations methods that are called at startup.

            Usually not needed if using the configuration store.
            """
            #Example publish to pubsub
            #self.vip.pubsub.publish('pubsub', "some/random/topic", message="HI!")

            #Exmaple RPC call
            #self.vip.rpc.call("some_agent", "some_method", arg1, arg2)

        @Core.receiver("onstop")
        def onstop(self, sender, **kwargs):
            """
            This method is called when the Agent is about to shutdown, but before it disconnects from
            the message bus.
            """
            pass


Agent Remote Procedure Calls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An agent may receive commands from other agents via a Remote Procedure Call (RPC).
This is done with the `@RPC.export` decorator:

.. code-block:: python

        @RPC.export
        def rpc_method(self, arg1, arg2, kwarg1=None, kwarg2=None):
            """
            RPC method

            May be called from another agent via self.core.rpc.call """
            return self.setting1 + arg1 - arg2


Packaging Configuration
-----------------------

The wizard will automatically create a `setup.py` file. This file sets up the name, version, required packages, method
to execute, etc. for the agent based on your answers to the wizard. The packaging process will also use this
information to name the resulting file.

.. code-block:: python

    from setuptools import setup, find_packages

    MAIN_MODULE = 'agent'

    # Find the agent package that contains the main module
    packages = find_packages('.')
    agent_package = 'tester'

    # Find the version number from the main module
    agent_module = agent_package + '.' + MAIN_MODULE
    _temp = __import__(agent_module, globals(), locals(), ['__version__'], -1)
    __version__ = _temp.__version__

    # Setup
    setup(
        name=agent_package + 'agent',
        version=__version__,
        author_email="volttron@pnnl.gov",
        url="https://volttron.org/",
        description="Agent development tutorial.",
        author="VOLTTRON Team",
        install_requires=['volttron'],
        packages=packages,
        entry_points={
            'setuptools.installation': [
                'eggsecutable = ' + agent_module + ':main',
            ]
        }
    )


Launch Configuration
--------------------

In TestAgent, the wizard will automatically create a JSON file called "config". It contains configuration information
for the agent.  This file contains examples of every data type supported by the configuration system:

::

    {
      # VOLTTRON config files are JSON with support for python style comments.
      "setting1": 2, #Integers
      "setting2": "some/random/topic2", #Strings
      "setting3": true, #Booleans: remember that in JSON true and false are not capitalized.
      "setting4": false,
      "setting5": 5.1, #Floating point numbers.
      "setting6": [1,2,3,4], #Lists
      "setting7": {"setting7a": "a", "setting7b": "b"} #Objects
    }


.. _Agent-Packaging-and-Install:

Packaging and Installing the Agent
----------------------------------

To install the agent the platform must be running. Start the platform with the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./start-volttron

.. note::

    If you are not in an activated environment, this script will start the platform running in the background in the
    correct environment. However the environment will not be activated for you; you must activate it yourself.

Now we must install it into the platform. Use the following command to install it and add a tag for easily referring to
the agent. From the project directory, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    python scripts/install-agent.py -s TestAgent/ -c TestAgent/config -t testagent

To verify it has been installed, use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    vctl list

This will result in output similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

      AGENT                    IDENTITY           TAG        Status     Health      PRI
  df  testeragent-0.5          testeragent-0.5_1  testagent

* The first string is a unique portion of the full UUID for the agent
* AGENT is the "name" of the agent based on the contents of its class name and the version in its setup.py.
* IDENTITY is the agent's identity in the platform. This is automatically assigned based on class name and instance
  number. This agent's ID is _1 because it is the first instance.
* TAG is the name we assigned in the command above
* Status indicates the running status of an agent - running agents are *running*, agents which are not running will have
  no listed status
* Health is an indication of the internal state of the agent.  'Healthy' agents will have GOOD health.  If an agent
  enters an error state, it will continue to run, but its health will be BAD.
* PRI is the priority for agents which have been "enabled" using the ``vctl enable`` command.

When using lifecycle commands on agents, they can be referred to by the UUID (default) or AGENT (name) or TAG.


Testing the Agent
=================


From the Command Line
---------------------

To test the agent, we will start the platform (if not already running), launch the agent, and check the log file.
With the VOLTTRON environment activated, start the platform by running (if needed):

.. code-block:: bash

    ./start-volttron

You can launch the agent in three ways, all of which you can find by using the `vctl list` command:

* By using the <uuid>:

.. code-block:: bash

    vctl start <uuid>

* By name:

.. code-block:: bash

    vctl start --name testeragent-0.1

* By tag:

.. code-block:: bash

    vctl start --tag testagent

Check that it is :ref:`running <Agent-Status>`:

.. code-block:: bash

    vctl status

* Start the ListenerAgent as in the :ref:`platform installation guide <Platform-Installation>`.
* Check the log file for messages indicating the TestAgent is receiving the ListenerAgents messages:

.. code-block:: bash

    TODO


Automated Test cases and documentation
--------------------------------------

Before contributing a new agent to the VOLTTRON source code repository, please consider adding two other essential
elements.

1. Integration and unit test cases
2. README file that includes details of pre-requisite software, agent setup details (such as setting up databases,
   permissions, etc.) and sample configuration

VOLTTRON uses *pytest* as a framework for executing tests.  All unit tests should be based on the *pytest* framework.
For instructions on writing unit and integration tests with *pytest*, refer to the
:ref:`Writing Agent Tests <Writing-Agent-Tests>` documentation.

*pytest* is not installed with the distribution by default. To install py.test and it's dependencies execute the
following:

.. code-block:: bash

    python bootstrap.py --testing

.. note::

  There are other options for different agent requirements.  To see all of the options use:

  .. code-block:: bash

    python bootstrap.py --help

  in the Extra Package Options section.

To run a single test module, use the command

.. code-block:: bash

    pytest <testmodule.py>

To run all of the tests in the volttron repository execute the following in the root directory using an activated
command prompt:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./ci-integration/run-tests.sh


.. _Utility-Scripts:

Scripts
=======

In order to make repetitive tasks less repetitive the VOLTTRON team has create several scripts in order to help.  These
tasks are available in the `scripts` directory.

.. note::

    In addition to the `scripts` directory, the VOLTTRON team has added the config directory to the .gitignore file.  By
    convention this is where we store customized scripts and configuration that will not be made public.  Please feel
    free to use this convention in your own processes.

The `scripts/core` directory is laid out in such a way that we can build scripts on top of a base core.  For example the
scripts in sub-folders such as the `historian-scripts` and `demo-comms` use the scripts that are present in the core
directory.

The most widely used script is `scripts/install-agent.py`.  The `install_agent.py` script will remove an agent if the
tag is already present, create a new agent package, and install the agent to `VOLTTRON_HOME`.  This script has three
required arguments and has the following signature:

::

    # Agent to Package must have a setup.py in the root of the directory.
    scripts/install_agent.py <Agent to Package> <Config file> <Tag>

The `install_agent.py` script will respect the `VOLTTRON_HOME` specified on the command line or set in the global
environment.  An example of setting `VOLTTRON_HOME` is as follows.

::

    # Sets VOLTTRON_HOME to /tmp/v1home
    VOLTTRON_HOME=/tmp/v1home scripts/core/pack_install.sh <Agent to Package> <Config file> <Tag>

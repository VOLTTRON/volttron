The VOLTTRON project is transitioning into the Eclipse Foundation as Eclipse VOLTTRON. Current resources will still
be used during this time. Please watch this space!

The Eclipse VOLTTRON team aims to work with users and contributors to continuously improve the platform with features
requested by the community as well as architectural features that improve robustness, security, and scalability.
Contributing back to the project, which is encouraged but not required, enhances its capabilities for the whole community.

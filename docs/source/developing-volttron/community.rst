The VOLTTRON project is transitioning into the Eclipse Foundation as Eclipse VOLTTRON. Current resources will still
be used during this time. Please watch this space!

The Eclipse VOLTTRON team aims to work with users and contributors to continuously improve the platform with features
requested by the community as well as architectural features that improve robustness, security, and scalability.
Contributing back to the project, which is encouraged but not required, enhances its capabilities for the whole community.
To learn more, check out :ref:`Contributing <Contributing-Code>` and :ref:`Documentation <Contributing-Documentation>`.

Office Hours
============

PNNL hosts office hours every other week on Fridays at 11 AM (PST). These meetings are designed to be very informal
where VOLTTRON developers can answer specific questions about the inner workings of VOLTTRON. These meetings are also
available for topical discussions of different aspects of the VOLTTRON platform. Currently the office hours are
available through a Zoom meeting. All members of the mailing list will receive invites to the meetings.  Join the

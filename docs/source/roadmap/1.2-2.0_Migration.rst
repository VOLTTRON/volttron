Migration from 1.2 - 2.0
========================

The most significant changes to the base VOLTTRON platform are the set
of commands for controlling the platform and the way agents are managed.

Existing agent code does not need to be modified except in cases of
hardcoded paths and some imports. The way agents are packaged has
changed but that does not change the setup.py file or any configuration
agents were using.

Summary of changes:

-  "lite" has been removed from the code tree. For packages, "lite" has
   been replaced by "platform".
-  The agents are no longer built as eggs but are instead built as
   Python wheels
-  There is a new package command instead of using a script to build an
   egg
-  Agents are no longer installed with a 2 step process of
   "install-executable" and "load-agent". Now the agent package is
   configured then installed.
-  Agents are no longer distinguished by their configuration files but
   can by a platform provided uuid and/or a user supplied tag.
-  The base topic for publishing data from devices is no longer "RTU"
   but "devices"
-  Application configuration files no longer need to contain the "exec"
   information. For an example of launching a non-Python agent, please
   see `ProcessAgent <ProcessAgent>`__

Overview

VOLTTRONâ„¢ is an open-source distributed control and sensing platform for integrating buildings
and the power grid. VOLTTRON connects devices, agents in the platform, agents in the Cloud, and
signals from the power grid. The platform also supports use cases such as demand response and
integration of distributed renewable energy sources.

VOLTTRON provides an environment for agent execution and serves as a single point of contact for
interfacing with devices (rooftop units, building systems, meters, etc.), external resources, and platform
services such as data archival and retrieval. VOLTTRON applications are referred to as agents since
VOLTTRON provides an agent-based programming paradigm to ease application development and
minimize the lines of code that need to be written by domain experts such as buildings engineers.
VOLTTRON provides a collection of utility and helper classes that simplifies agent development.

The VOLTTRON white paper provides an overview of the capabilities of the platform:

New smart grid technologies are creating a significant potential for smart building systems to provide grid services to power system operators. Communication networks and advanced control systems are a necessary enabler of this new potential. VOLTTRON was designed as an open-source distributed control and sensing platform for integrating buildings and the power grid by connecting devices, agents in the platform, agents in the Cloud, and signals from the power grid.

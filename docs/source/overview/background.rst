VOLTTRON serves as an integrating platform for the components of the Transactional Network project. It provides an environment for agent execution and serves as a single point of contact for interfacing with devices (RTU HVACs, power meters, etc.), external resources, and platform services such as data archival and retrieval. The VOLTTRON platform provides a collection of utility and helper classes that simplifies agent development. In the Transactional Network project, VOLTTRON connects devices (RTU HVACs, power meters, etc.) to applications implemented in the platform and in the cloud, a data historian, and signals from the power grid. It also provides helper classes to ease development and deployment of agents into the environment.

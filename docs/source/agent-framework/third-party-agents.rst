.. _Third-Party-Agents:

Acquiring Third Party Agent Code
================================

Third party agents developed from a variety of sources are available from the volttron-applications repository (https://github.com/VOLTTRON/volttron-applications.git).  The current best practice is to have the main volttron and the volttron-applications repository within the same common ancestry folder.

.. code-block:: bash

  volttron-repositories/
  |
  |--- volttron/
  |
  |--- volttron-applications/

One can clone the latest applications from the repository via the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/VOLTTRON/volttron-applications.git

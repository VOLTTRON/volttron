Example Agents Overview
=======================

Some example agents are included with the platform to help explore its features.  These agents represent concrete
implementations of important agent sub-types such as Historians or Weather Agents, or demonstrate a development pattern
for accomplishing common tasks.

More complex agents contributed by other researchers can also be found in the examples directory.  It is recommended
that developers new to VOLTTRON understand the example agents first before diving into the other agents.

.. _IEEE-2030_5-Agent:

=====================
IEEE 2030.5 DER Agent
=====================

The IEEE 2030.5 Agent (IEEE2030_5 in the VOLTTRON repository) implements a IEEE 2030.5 server that receives HTTP
`POST`/`PUT` requests from IEEE 2030.5 devices.  The requests are routed to the IEEE 2030.5 Agent over the VOLTTRON
message bus by VOLTTRON's Master Web Service.  The IEEE 2030.5 Agent returns an appropriate HTTP response.  In some
cases (e.g., DERControl requests), this response includes a data payload.

The IEEE 2030.5 Agent maps IEEE 2030.5 resource data to a VOLTTRON IEEE 2030.5 data model based on SunSpec, using block
numbers and point names as defined in the SunSpec Information Model, which in turn is harmonized with 61850.  The data
model is given in detail below.

Each device's data is stored by the IEEE 2030.5 Agent in an `EndDevice` memory structure.  This structure is not
persisted to a database.  Each `EndDevice` retains only the most recently received value for each field.

The IEEE2030_5 Agent exposes RPC calls for getting and setting EndDevice data.


VOLTTRON IEEE 2030.5 Device Driver
----------------------------------

The :ref:`IEEE 2030.5 device driver <IEEE-2030_5-Driver>` is a new addition to VOLTTRON Platform Driver Agent's
family of standard device drivers.  It exposes ``get_point``/``set_point calls`` for IEEE 2030.5 EndDevice fields.

The IEEE 2030.5 device driver periodically issues IEEE2030_5 Agent RPC calls to refresh its cached representation of
EndDevice data.  It issues RPC calls to IEEE2030_5Agent as needed when responding to ``get_point``, ``set_point`` and
``scrape_all`` calls.


Field Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These field IDs correspond to the ones in the IEEE 2030.5 device driver's configuration file, ``ieee2030_5.csv``.
They have been used in that file's "Volttron Point Name" column and also in its "Point Name" column.

Revising and Expanding the Field Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The IEEE 2030.5-to-SunSpec field mappings in this implementation are a relatively thin subset of all possible
field definitions. Developers are encouraged to expand the definitions.

The procedure for expanding the field mappings requires you to make changes in two places:

1. Update the driver's point definitions in ``services/core/PlatformDriverAgent/platform_driver/ieee2030_5.csv``
2. Update the IEEE 2030.5-to-SunSpec field mappings in ``services/core/IEEE2030_5Agent/ieee2030_5/end_device.py`` and
   ``__init__.py``

When updating VOLTTRON's IEEE 2030.5 data model, please use field IDs that conform to the SunSpec
block-number-and-field-name model outlined in the SunSpec Information Model Reference (see the link below).

View the :ref:`IEEE 2030.5 agent specification document <IEEE-2030_5-Specification>` to learn more about IEEE 2030.5 and
the IEEE 2030.5 agent and driver.

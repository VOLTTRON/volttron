.. _IEEE-2030_5-Specification:

=======================
IEEE 2030.5 DER Support
=======================

Version 1.0

Smart Energy Profile 2.0 (SEP 2.0, IEEE 2030.5) specifies a REST architecture built around the core HTTP verbs: GET,
HEAD, PUT, POST and DELETE.  A specification for the IEEE 2030.5 protocol can be found
`here <https://standards.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-standards/standards/web/documents/presentations/smart_energy_slides.pdf>`_.

IEEE 2030.5 EndDevices (clients) POST XML resources representing their state, and GET XML resources containing command
and control information from the server.  The server never reaches out to the client unless a "subscription" is
registered and supported for a particular resource type.  This implementation does not use IEEE 2030.5 registered
subscriptions.

The IEEE 2030.5 specification requires HTTP headers, and it explicitly requires RESTful response codes, for example:

    -   201 - "Created"
    -   204 - "No Content"
    -   301 - "Moved Permanently"
    -   etc.

IEEE 2030.5 message encoding may be either XML or EXI.  Only XML is supported in this implementation.

IEEE 2030.5 requires HTTPS/TLS version 1.2 along with support for the cipher suite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8.
Production installation requires a certificate issued by a IEEE 2030.5 CA.  The encryption requirement can be met by
using a web server such as Apache to proxy the HTTPs traffic.

IEEE 2030.5 discovery, if supported, must be implemented by an xmDNS server.  Avahi can be modified to perform this
function.


Function Sets
=============

IEEE 2030.5 groups XML resources into "Function Sets."  Some of these function sets provide a core set of functionality
used across higher-level function sets.  This implementation implements resources from the following function sets:

    -   Time
    -   Device Information
    -   Device Capabilities
    -   End Device
    -   Function Set Assignments
    -   Power Status
    -   Distributed Energy Resources


Distributed Energy Resources (DERs)
-----------------------------------

Distributed energy resources (DERs) are devices that generate energy, e.g., solar inverters, or store energy, e.g.,
battery storage systems, electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSEs).  These devices are managed by a IEEE 2030.5 DER
server using DERPrograms which are described by the IEEE 2030.5 specification as follows:

    Servers host one or more DERPrograms, which in turn expose DERControl events to DER clients.
    DERControl instances contain attributes that allow DER clients to respond to events
    that are targeted to their device type. A DERControl instance also includes scheduling
    attributes that allow DER clients to store and process future events. These attributes
    include start time and duration, as well an indication of the need for randomization of
    the start and / or duration of the event. The IEEE 2030.5 DER client model is based on the
    SunSpec Alliance Inverter Control Model [SunSpec] which is derived from
    IEC 61850-90-7 [61850] and [EPRI].

EndDevices post multiple IEEE 2030.5 resources describing their status.  The following is an
example of a Power Status resource that might be posted by an EVSE (vehicle charging station):

    <PowerStatus xmlns="http://zigbee.org/sep" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" href="/sep2/edev/96/ps">

Design Details
--------------

.. image:: files/volttron_ieee2030_5.jpg

VOLTTRON's IEEE 2030.5 implementation includes a IEEE 2030.5 Agent and a IEEE 2030.5 device driver, as described below.


VOLTTRON IEEE 2030.5 Device Driver
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The IEEE 2030.5 device driver is a new addition to VOLTTRON Platform Driver Agent's family of standard device drivers.  It
exposes `get_point`/`set_point` calls for IEEE 2030.5 EndDevice fields.

The IEEE 2030.5 device driver periodically issues the IEEE 2030.5 Agent RPC calls to refresh its cached representation
of EndDevice data.  It issues RPC calls to the IEEE 2030.5 Agent as needed when responding to `get_point`, `set_point`
and `scrape_all` calls.

Field Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These field IDs correspond to the ones in the IEEE 2030.5 device driver's configuration file, `ieee2030_5.csv`.
They have been used in that file's `Volttron Point Name` column and also in its `Point Name` column.

Revising and Expanding the Field Definitions
--------------------------------------------

The IEEE 2030.5-to-SunSpec field mappings in this implementation are a relatively thin subset of all possible
field definitions.  Developers are encouraged to expand the definitions.

The procedure for expanding the field mappings requires you to make changes in two places:

1. Update the driver's point definitions in `services/core/PlatformDriverAgent/platform_driver/ieee2030_5.csv`
2. Update the IEEE 2030.5-to-SunSpec field mappings in `services/core/IEEE2030_5Agent/ieee2030_5/end_device.py` and
   `__init__.py`

When updating VOLTTRON's IEEE 2030.5 data model, please use field IDs that conform to the SunSpec
block-number-and-field-name model outlined in the SunSpec Information Model Reference (see the link below).

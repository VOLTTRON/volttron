 .. _Simulation-Integration:

=====================================
Integrating With Simulation Platforms
=====================================

An agent wanting to integrate with a simulation platform has to create an object of concrete simulation integration
class (HELICSSimIntegration).  This is best described with an example agent.  The example agent will interface with
HELICS co-simulation platform. For more info about HELICS, please refer to
https://helics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/linux.html.

.. code-block:: python

    class HelicsExample(Agent):
        """
        HelicsExampleAgent demonstrates how VOLTTRON agent can interact with HELICS simulation environment
        """
        def __init__(self, config, **kwargs):
            super(HelicsExample, self).__init__(enable_store=False, **kwargs)
                self.config = config
                self.helics_sim = HELICSSimIntegration(config, self.vip.pubsub)


.. _Register-Simulation:

Register With Simulation Platform
=================================

The agent has to first load the configuration file containing parameters such as connection address, simulation
duration, input and output topics etc., and register with simulation platform.  The concrete simulation object will then
register the agent with simulation platform (in this case, HELICS) using appropriate APIs.  The registration steps
include connecting to the simulation platform, passing the input and outputs topics to the simulation etc.  In addition
to that, the agent has to provide a callback method in order for the concrete simulation object to pass the messages
received from the simulation to the agent.  The best place to call the `register_inputs` API is within the `onstart`
method of the agent.

.. code-block:: python

    @Core.receiver("onstart")
    def onstart(self, sender, **kwargs):
        """
        Register config parameters with HELICS.
        Start HELICS simulation.
        """
        # Register inputs with HELICS and provide callback method to receive messages from simulation
        try:
            self.helics_sim.register_inputs(self.config, self.do_work)
        except ValueError as ex:
            _log.error("Unable to register inputs with HELICS: {}".format(ex))
            self.core.stop()
            return


Start the Simulation Platform
=============================

After registering with the simulation platform, the agent can start the simulation.

.. code-block:: python

    # Register inputs with HELICS and provide callback method to receive messages from simulation
    try:
        self.helics_sim.start_simulation()
    except ValueError as ex:
        _log.error("Unable to register inputs with HELICS: {}".format(ex))
        self.core.stop()
        return


Receive outputs from the simulation
===================================

The concrete simulation object spawns a continuous loop that waits for any incoming messages (subscription messages)
from the simulation platform.  On receiving a message, it passes the message to the callback method registered by the
agent during the :ref:`register with simulation step <Register-Simulation>`.  The agent can now choose to work on the
incoming message based on it's use case.  The agent can also choose to publish some message back to the simulation at
this point of time as shown in below example.  This is totally optional and is based on agent's use-case.  At the end of
the callback method, the agent needs to make time request to the simulation, so that it can advance forward in the
simulation.  Please note, this is a necessary step for HELICS co-simulation integration as the HELICS broker waits for
time requests from all it's federates before advancing the simulation.  If no time request is made, the broker blocks
the simulation.


.. code-block:: python

    def do_work(self):
        """
        Perform application specific work here using HELICS messages
        :return:
        """
        current_values = self.helics_sim.current_values
        _log.debug("Doing work: {}".format(self.core.identity))
        _log.debug("Current set of values from HELICS: {}".format(current_values))
        # Do something with HELICS messages
        # agent specific work!!!

        for pub in self.publications:
            key = pub['sim_topic']
            # Check if VOLTTRON topic has been configured. If no, publish dummy value for the HELICS
            # publication key
            volttron_topic = pub.get('volttron_topic', None)
            if volttron_topic is None:
                value = 90.5
                global_flag = pub.get('global', False)
                # If global flag is False, prepend federate name to the key
                if not global_flag:
                    key = "{fed}/{key}".format(fed=self._federate_name, key=key)
                    value = 67.90
                self.helics_sim.publish_to_simulation(key, value)

        self.helics_sim.make_time_request()


Publish to the simulation
=========================

The agent can publish messages to the simulation using publish_to_simulation API. The code snippet iterates over all the
publication keys (topics) and uses `publish_to_simulation` API to publish a dummy value of ``67.90`` for every
publication key.

.. code-block:: python

    for pub in self.publications:
        key = pub['sim_topic']
        value = 67.90
        self.helics_sim.publish_to_simulation(key, value)


Advance the simulation
======================

With some simulation platforms such as HELICS, the federate can make explicit time request to advance in time by certain
number of time steps. There will be a global time keeper (in this case HELICS broker) which will be responsible for
maintaining time within the simulation.  In the time request mode, each federate has to request for time advancement
after it has completed it's work.  The global time keeper grants the lowest time among all time requests.  All the
federates receive the granted time and advance forward in simulation time together in a synchronized manner.  Please
note, the granted time may not be the same as the requested time by the agent.

Typically, the best place to make the time request is in the callback method provided to the simulation integration
object.

.. code-block:: python

    self.helics_sim.make_time_request()


Pause the simulation
====================

Some simulation platforms such as GridAPPS-D have the capability to pause the simulation. The agent can make use of
this functionality by calling the appropriate wrapper API exposed by the concrete simulation class. In the case of
HELICS, we do not have capability of pause/resume simulation, so calling the `pause_simulation` API will result in no
operation.

.. code-block:: python

    self.helics_sim.pause_simulation()


Resume the simulation
=====================

If the simulation platform provides the pause simulation functionality then it will also provide capability to resume
the simulation. The agent can call resume_simulation API to resume the simulation. In case of HELICS, we do not have the
capability of pause/resume simulation, so calling the `resume_simulation` API will result in no operation.

.. code-block:: python

    self.helics_sim.resume_simulation()


Stop the simulation
===================

The agent can stop the simulation at any point of point. In the case of `HELICSSimIntegration object`, it will
disconnect the federate from the HELICS core and close the library.  Generally, it is a good practice to call the
`stop_simulation` API within the `onstop` method of the agent. In this way, the agent stops the simulation before
exiting the process.

.. code-block:: python

    @Core.receiver("onstop")
    def onstop(self, sender, **kwargs):
        """
        This method is called when the Agent is about to shutdown, but before it
        disconnects from the message bus.
        """
        self.helics_sim.stop_simulation()

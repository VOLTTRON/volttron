Python for Matlab Users
=======================

Matlab is a popular, proprietary programming language and tool suite with built
in support for matrix operations and graphically plotting computation results.
The purpose of this document is to introduce Python to those already familiar
Matlab so it will be easier for them to develop tools and agents in VOLTTRON.

A Simple Function
-----------------

Python and Matlab are similar in many respects, syntactically and semantically.
With the addition of the NumPy library in Python, almost all numerical
operations in Matlab can be emulated or directly translated. Here are functions
in each language that perform the same operation:

.. code-block:: matlab

   % Matlab
   function [result] = times_two(number)
       result = number * 2;
   end

.. code-block:: python

   # Python
   def times_two(number):
       result = number * 2
       return result

Some notes about the previous functions:

#. Values are explicitly returned with the `return` statement. It is possible
   to return multiple values, as in Matlab, but doing this without a good reason
   can lead to overcomplicated functions.

#. Semicolons are not used to end statements in python, and white space is
   significant. After a block is started (if, for, while, functions, classes)
   subsequent lines should be indented with four spaces. The block ends when the
   programmer stops adding the extra level of indentation.

Translating
-----------

The following may be helpful if you already have a Matlab file or function
that will be translated into Python. Many of the syntactic differences
between Matlab and Python can be rectified with your text editor's find and
replace feature.

Start by copying all of your Matlab code into a new file with a `.py`
extension. I recommend commenting everything out and uncommenting the
Matlab code in chunks. This way you can write valid Python and verify
it as you translate, instead of waiting till the whole file is "translated".
Editors designed to work with Python should be able to highlight syntax errors
for you as well.

#. Comments are created with a `%`. Find and replace these with `#`.

#. Change `elseif` blocks to `elif` blocks.

#. Python indexes start at zero instead of one. Array slices
   and range operations, however,  don't include the upper bound, so only the
   lower bound should decrease by one.

#. Semicolons in Matlab are used to suppress output at the
   end of lines and for organizing array literals. After arranging the arrays
   into nested lists, all semicolons can be removed.

#. The `end` keyword in Matlab is used both to access the last element
   in an array and to close blocks. The array use case can be replaced with `-1`
   and the others can be removed entirely.


A More Concrete Example
-----------------------

In the `Building Economic Dispatch <https://github.com/VOLTTRON/econ-dispatch>`_
project, a sibling project to VOLTTRON, a number of components written in Matlab
would create a matrix out of some collection of columns and perform least
squares regression using the `matrix division` operator. This is straightforward
and very similar in both languages so long as all of the columns are defined and
are the same length.

.. code-block:: matlab

   % Matlab
   XX = [U, xbp, xbp2, xbp3, xbp4, xbp5];
   AA = XX \ ybp;

.. code-block:: python

   # Python
   import numpy as np

   XX = np.column_stack((U, xbp, xbp2, xbp3, xbp4, xbp5))
   AA, resid, rank, s = np.linalg.lstsq(XX, ybp)

This pattern also included the creation of the `U` column, a column of
ones used as the bias term in the linear equation. In order to make the Python
version more readable and more robust, the pattern was removed from each
component and replaced with a single function call to
`least_squares_regression`.

This function does some validation on the input
parameters, automatically creates the bias column, and returns the least squares
solution to the system. Now if we want to change how the solution is calculated
we only have to change the one function, instead of each instance where the
pattern was written originally.

.. code-block:: python

   def least_squares_regression(inputs=None, output=None):
       if inputs is None:
           raise ValueError("At least one input column is required")
       if output is None:
           raise ValueError("Output column is required")

       if type(inputs) != tuple:
           inputs = (inputs,)

       ones = np.ones(len(inputs[0]))
       x_columns = np.column_stack((ones,) + inputs)

       solution, resid, rank, s = np.linalg.lstsq(x_columns, output)
       return solution

Lessons Learned (sometimes the hard way)
----------------------------------------

Variable Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use descriptive function and variable names whenever possible. The most
important things to consider here are reader comprehension and searching.
Consider a  variable called `hdr`. Is it `header` without any vowels, or is it
short for `high-dynamic-range`? Spelling out full words in variable names can
save someone else a lot of guesswork.

Searching comes in when we're looking for instances of a string or variable.
Single letter variable names are impossible to search for. Variables with two
or three characters are often not much better.

Matlab load/save
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Matlab has built-in functions to automatically save and load variables from your
programs to disk. Using these functions can lead to poor program design and
should be avoided if possible. It would be best to refactor as you translate if
they are being used. Few operations are so expensive that that cannot be
redone every time the program is run. For part of the program that saves
variables, consider making a function that simply returns them instead.

If your Matlab program is loading csv files then use the Pandas library when
working in python. Pandas works well with NumPy and is the go-to library when
using csv files that contain numeric data.

.. _FakeDriver:
Fake Driver
==============

The FakeDriver is included as a way to quickly see data published to the message bus in a format 
that mimics what a true Driver would produce. This is an extremely simple implementation of the 
:ref:`VOLTTRON driver framework<VOLTTRON-Driver-Framework>`   

Make a script to build and deploy the fake driver.

- Create a config directory (if one doesn't already exist). All local config files will be 
  worked on here.
- cp examples/configurations/drivers/fake.config config/
- Edit registry_config for the paths on your system

fake.config::

    {
        "driver_config": {},
        "registry_config":"config://fake.csv",
        "interval": 5,
        "timezone": "US/Pacific",
        "heart_beat_point": "Heartbeat",
        "driver_type": "fakedriver",
        "publish_breadth_first_all": false,
        "publish_depth_first": false,
        "publish_breadth_first": false
   	}

- cp examples/configurations/drivers/master-driver.agent config/fake-master-driver.config
- Add fake.csv and fake.config to the :ref:`configuration store<config-store>`.
- Edit fake-master-driver.config to reflect paths on your system

fake-master-driver.config::

    {
        "driver_scrape_interval": 0.05
    }

- Create a script to simplify installation. The following will stop and remove any existing
  instances of agents create with the script, then package, install, and start the new instance.
  You will need to make the file executable: chmod +x make-fakedriver

make-fakedriver::

	export SOURCE=services/core/MasterDriverAgent
	export CONFIG=config/fake-master-driver.agent
	export TAG=fake-driver
	./scripts/core/make-agent.sh
	

- If you have a :ref:`Listener Agent<Listener-Agent>` already installed, you should start seeing data being published to the bus.

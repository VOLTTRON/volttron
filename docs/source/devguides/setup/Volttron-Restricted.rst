VOLTTRON Restricted Code
=========================

Volttron Restricted adds a broader security layer on top of the volttron
platform. If you are interested in this package please contact the
volttron team at volttron@pnnl.gov.

-  NOTE: Once the package is installed all aspects of the package will
   be enforced. To override the behavior add no-verify, no-mobility, or
   no-resource-monitor to the `configuration
   file <PlatformConfiguration>`__.

The Volttron Restricted package contains the following security
enhancements:

-  The creation and usage of platform specific Certificate Authority
   (CA) certificates.
-  Multi-level signing of agent packages.
-  Multi-level verification of signed packages during agent execution.
-  Command line and agent based mobility.
-  Allows developer to customize an execution contract for required
   resources on the current and move requested platform.

The following pages describe the functionality exposed by the Volttron
Restricted package:

-  `Signing and Verification of Agent Packages <Agent-Signing>`__
-  `Resource Monitor <Resource%20Monitor>`__

Migration from 3.0 to 3.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drivers
=======

The BACnet driver configurations now require device ids.

3.0 configurations had the line:

::

    "driver_config": {"device_address": address},

3.5 configs needs the following addition to the the *driver_config* dictionary:

::

    "driver_config": {"device_address": address,
                      "device_id": id},


Historian
=========

The 3.5 MySQL historian will try adding rows to a metadata table but will
not create the table automatically. It can be added to the database with

.. code-block:: sql

    CREATE TABLE meta(topic_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
                      metadata TEXT NOT NULL,
                      PRIMARY KEY(topic_id));


ActuatorAgent
=============

The Heartbeat agent has been removed in version 3.5, its job now being
done from within the actuator. The period of the heartbeat toggle function
can be set by adding

::

    "heartbeat_period": 20

to the actuator's config file. This period defaults to 60 seconds if it
is not specified.

3.X drivers
===========

Changes from v2.X
-----------------

-  PNNL Point Name is now: Volttron Point Name
-  Drivers are now agents
-  No more smap config file, now it is an Agent config file.
-  MODBUS, add port argument to driver\_config dictionary
-  BACnet Change of Value services are supported by the Master
   Driver Agent starting with version 3.2.
-  Agent config file has links to driver config files which have links
   to driver register file.

Edit the master driver config. This points to the configuration files
for specific drivers. Each of these drivers uses a CSV file to specify
their points (registry file).

Master Driver Config
--------------------

-  agentid - name of agent
-  driver\_config\_list - list of configuration files for drivers under
   this master

   | {
   |  "agentid": "master\_driver",
   |  "driver\_config\_list": [
   | 
   "/home/user/git/volttron/services/core/MasterDriverAgent/master\_driver/test\_modbus1.config"
   |  ]
   |  }

Device Driver Config
--------------------

-  driver\_config - driver specific information, modbus just needs the
   ip for the device being controlled
-  campus/building/unit - path to the device
-  driver\_type - specify the type of driver (modbus, bacnet, custom)
-  registry\_config - the registry file specifying points to collect
-  interval - how often to grab/publish data
-  timezone - TZ of data being collected
-  heart\_beat\_point - registry point to use as a hearbeat to indicate
   that VOLTTRON is still controlling device

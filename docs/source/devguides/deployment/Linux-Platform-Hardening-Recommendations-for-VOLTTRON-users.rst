Introduction
============

| VOLTTRON is an agent-based application development platform for
| distributed control systems. VOLTTRON itself is built with modern
| security principles in mind [security-wp] and implements many security
| features for hosted agents. However, VOLTTRON is built on top of Linux
| and the underlying Linux platform also needs to be secured in order to
| declare the resulting control system as "secure." Any system is only
| as secure as its weakest link. The rest of this note is dedicated to
| making recommendations for hardening of the underlying Linux platform
| that VOLTTRON uses. Note that no system can be 100% secure and the
cyber security strategy that is recommended in this document is based on
risk management.

Linux System Hardening
======================

| Here are the non-exhaustive recommendations for Linux
| hardening from the VOLTTRON team:

-  | Physical Security: Keep the system in locked cabinets or
   |  a locked room. Limit physical access to systems and to the
   networks
   |  to which they are attached. The goal should be to avoid physical
   access by
   |  untrusted personnel. This could be extended to blocking or locking
   USB ports,
   |  removable media drives, etc.
   |  Drive encryption could be
   |  used to avoid access via alternate-media booting (off USB stick or
   DVD) if
   |  physical access can't be guaranteed. Downside of drive encryption
   would be
   |  needing to enter a passphrase to start system. Alternately, the
   |  Trusted Platform Module (TPM) may be used, but the drive might
   still
   |  be accessible to those with physical access. Enable chassis
   |  intrusion detection and reporting if supported. If available, use
   a
   |  physical tamper seal along with or in place of an interior switch.

-  | Low level device Security: Keep firmware of all devices (including
   |  BIOS) up-to-date. Password-protect the BIOS. Disable
   |  unneeded/unnecessary devices including serial, parallel, USB,
   |  Firewire, etc. ports; optical drives; wireless devices, such as
   |  Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Leaving a USB port enabled may be helpful if
   a
   |  breach occurs to allow saving forensic data to an external drive.

-  | Boot security: Disable automounting of external devices. Restrict
   |  the boot device. Disable PXE and other network boot options
   (unless
   |  that is the primary boot method). Disable booting from USB and
   other
   |  removable drives. Secure the boot loader. Require an administrator
   |  password to do anything but start the default kernel. Do not allow
   |  editing of kernel parameters. Disable, remove, or password-protect
   |  emergency/recovery boot entries.

-  | Security Updates: First and foremost, configure the system to
   |  automatically download security updates. Most security updates can
   |  be installed without rebooting the system, but some updated
   |  (e.g. shared libraries, kernel, etc) require the system to be
   |  rebooted. If possible, configure the system to install the
   security
   |  updates automatically and reboot at a particular time. We also
   |  recommend reserving the reboot time (e.g. 1:30AM on a Saturday
   |  morning) using the Actuator Agent so that no control actions can
   |  happen during that time.

-  | System Access only via Secured Protocols: Disallow all clear text
   |  access to VOLTTRON systems. No telnet, no rsh, no ftp and no
   |  exceptions. Use ssh to gain console access, and scp/sftp to get
   files in
   |  and out of the system. Disconnect excessively idle SSH Sessions.

-  | Disable remote login for "root" users. Do not allow a user to
   |  directly access the system as the "root" user from a remote
   network
   |  location. Root access to privileged operations can be accomplished
   |  using “sudo” This adds an extra level of security by restricting
   |  access to privileged operations and tracking those operations
   |  through the system log.

-  | Manage users and usernames. Limit the number of user accounts. Use
   |  complex usernames rather than first names.

-  | Authentication. If possible, use two factor authentication to allow
   |  access to the system. Informally, two factor authentication uses
   |  a combination of "something you know" and "something you have"
   |  to allow access to the
   |  system. RSA SecurID tokens are commonly used for two factor
   |  authentication but other tools are available. When not using
   |  two-factor authentication, use strong passwords and do not share
   |  accounts.

-  | Scan for weak passwords. Use password cracking tools such as John
   |  the Ripper (http://www.openwall.com/john/) or nmap with password
   |  cracking modules (http://nmap.org) to look for weak passwords.

-  | Utilize Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) to strengthen
   |  passwords and the login process. We recommend:

   -  pam\_abl: Automated blacklisting on repeated failed
       authentication attempts
   -  pam\_captcha: A visual text-based CAPTCHA challenge module
       for PAM
   -  pam\_passwdqc: A password strength checking module for PAM-aware
      password changing programs
   -  pam\_cracklib: PAM module to check the password against dictionary
      words
   -  pam\_pwhistory: PAM module to remember last passwords

-  | Disable unwanted services. Most desktop and server Linux
   |  distributions come with many unnecessary services enabled. Disable
   |  all unnecessary services. Refer to your distribution's
   documentation
   |  to discover how to check and disable these services.

-  | Just as scanning for weak passwords is a step to more secure
   systems,
   |  regular network scans using Nmap (www.nmap.org) to find what
   network
   |  services are being offered is another step towards a more secure
   |  system. Note, use nmap or similar tools very carefully on BACnet
   and modbus
   |  environments. These scanning tools are known to crash/reset BACnet
   and modbus
   |  devices.

-  | Control incoming and outgoing network traffic. Use the built-in
   |  host-based firewall to control who/what can connect to this
   |  system. Many iptables frontends offer a set of predefined rules
   that
   |  provide a default deny policy for incoming connections and provide
   |  rules to prevent or limit other well known attacks (i.e. rules
   that
   |  limit certain responses that might amplify a DDoS attack). ufw
   |  (uncomplicated firewall) is a good example.
   |  For example, if the system administrators for the VOLTTRON
   |  device are all located in 10.10.10.0/24 subnetwork, then allow SSH
   |  and SCP logins from only that IP address range. If VOLTTRON system
   |  exports data to a historian at 10.20.20.1 using TCP port 443,
   allow
   |  outgoing traffic to that port on that server. The idea here is to
   |  limit the attack surface of the system. The smaller the surface,
   the
   |  better we can analyze the communication patterns of the system and
   |  detect anomalies. One word of caution. While some system
   |  administrators disable network-based diagnostic tools such as ICMP
   |  ECHO responses, VOLTTRON team believes that this hampers
   |  usability. As an example, monitoring which incoming and outgoing
   |  firewall rules are triggering can be accomplished with this
   command:
   |  ``watch --interval=5 'iptables -nvL | grep -v "0     0"'`` .

-  | Rate limit incoming connections to discourage brute force hacking
   |  attempts. Use a tool such as fail2ban
   |  (http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) to dynamically
   |  manage firewall rules to rate limit incoming connections and
   |  discourage brute force hacking attempts. sshguard
   |  (http://www.sshguard.net/) is similar to
   |  fail2ban but only used for ssh connections. Further rate limiting
   |  can be accomplished at the firewall level. As an example, you can
   |  restrict the number of connections used by a single IP address to
   |  your server using iptables. Only allow 4 ssh connections per
   client
   |  system:
   | 
   ``iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 22 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 4 –j DROP``
   |  You can limit the number of connections per minute. The following
   example will drop incoming connections if an IP address makes more
   than 10 connection attempts to port 22 within 60 seconds:
   | 
   ``iptables -A INPUT -p tcp –dport 22 -i eth0 -m state --state NEW -m recent --set``
   | 
   ``iptables -A INPUT -p tcp –dport 22 -i eth0 -m state --state NEW -m recent \         --update –-seconds 60 -–hitcount 10 –j DROP``

-  | Use a file system integrity tool to monitor for unexpected file
   |  changes. Tools such as tripwire
   |  (http://sourceforge.net/projects/tripwire/) to monitor filesystem
   |  for changed files. Another file integrity checking tool to
   consider
   |  is AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detect Environment)
   |  (http://aide.sourceforge.net/).

-  | Use filesystem scanning tools periodically to check for
   |  exploits. Available tools such as checkrootkit
   |  (http://www.chkrootkit.org), rkhunter
   |  (http://rkhunter.sourceforge.net) and others should be used to
   check
   |  for known exploits on a periodic basis and report their results.

-  | VOLTTRON does not use apache or require it. If Apache is being
   used,
   | we recommend using mod\_security and mod\_evasive modules.

System Monitoring
=================

-  | Monitor system state and resources. Use a monitoring tool such as
   |  Xymon (http://xymon.sourceforge.net) or big brother
   |  (http://www.bb4.org/features.html) to remotely monitor the system
   |  resources and state. Set the monitoring tools to alert the system
   |  administrators if anomalous use of resources (e.g. connections,
   |  memory, etc) are detected. An administrator can also use unix
   |  commands such as netstat to look for open connections
   periodically.

-  | Watch system logs and get logs off the system. Use a utility such
   as
   |  logwatch (http://sourceforge.net/projects/logwatch/files/) or
   |  logcheck (http://logcheck.org) to get
   |  daily summary of system activity via email. For Linux
   distributions
   |  that use systemd, use journalwatch
   |  (http://git.the-compiler.org/journalwatch/)
   |  to accomplish the same task.
   |  Additionally, use a remote syslog server to collect logs from all
   |  VOLTTRON systems in
   |  the field at a centralized location for analysis. A tool such as
   |  splunk is ideal for this task and comes with many built-in
   analysis
   |  applications. Another benefit of sending logs remotely off the
   platform
   |  is the ability to inspect the logs even when the platform may be
   |  compromised.

-  | An active intrusion sensor such as PSAD
   |  (http://cipherdyne.org/psad/) can be used to look for intrusions
   as well.

Security Testing
================

| Every security control discussed in the previous sections must be
| tested to determine correct operation and impact.
| For example, if we inserted a firewall rule to ban connections
| from an IP address such as 10.10.10.2, then we need to test that the
| connections actually fail.

| In addition to functional correctness testing, common security testing
| tools such as Nessus (http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) and nmap
| (http://nmap.org) should be used to perform cyber security testing.

Conclusion
==========

No system is 100% secure unless it is disconnected from the network and
is in a physically secure location. VOLTTRON team recommends a
risk-based cyber security approach that considers each risk, and the
impact of an exploit. Mitigating technologies can then be used to
mitigate the most impactful risks first. VOLTTRON is built with security
in mind from the ground up. But it is only as secure as the operating
system that it runs on top of. This document is intended to help
VOLTTRON users to secure the underlying Linux operating system to
further improve the robustness of the VOLTTRON platform. Any security
questions should be directed to volttron@pnnl.gov.

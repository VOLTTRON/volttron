Eclipse IDE Setup
=================

The only thing that is necessary to create a VOLTTRON agent is a text
editor and the shell. However, we have found the Eclipse Development
Environment (IDE) to be a valuable tool for helping to develop VOLTTRON
agents. You can obtain the latest (MARS as fo 10/7/15) from
http://www.eclipse.org/. Once downloaded the `PyDev Plugin <#pydev-plugin>`__
is a valuable tool for executing the platform as well as debugging agent code.

-  `Install PyDev Plugin <#pydev-plugin>`__
-  `Clone the VOLTTRON Source <#cloning-the-source-code>`__
-  `Build VOLTTRON <#build-volttron>`__
-  `Link Eclipse to VOLTTRON Python Environment <#linking-eclipse-and-the-volttron-python-environment>`__
-  `Make Project a PyDev Project <#make-project-a-pydev-project>`__
-  `Testing the Installation <#testing-the-installation>`__
-  `Execute VOLTTRON Through Shell <#execute-volttron-through-shell>`__
-  `Execute VOLTTRON Through Eclipse <#execute-volttron-through-eclipse>`__
-  `Start a ListenerAgent <#start-a-listeneragent>`__

PyDev Plugin
------------

Installing the PyDev plugin from the Eclipse Market place There is a
python plugin for eclipse that makes development much easier. Install it
from the eclipse marketplace.

|Help -> Eclipse Marketplace...|

|Click Install|

Cloning the Source Code
-----------------------

The VOLTTRON code is stored in a git repository. Eclipse (Luna and Mars)
come with a git plugin out of the box. For other versions the plugin is
available for Eclipse that makes development more convenient (note: you
must have Git :ref:`already installed <VOLTTRON-Prerequisites>` on the
system and have :ref:`built VOLTTRON <Building-VOLTTRON>`):

If your version of Eclipse does not have the marketplace follow these
:ref:`instructions <Manual-Plugin-Install>`.

The project can now be checked out from the repository into Eclipse.

#. Open the Git view

   |Select Git view|

#. Clone a Git Repository

   |Clone existing repo|

#. Fill out the URI: https://github.com/VOLTTRON/volttron

   |Select repo|

#. Select master for latest stable version

   |Select branch repo|

#. Import the cloned repository as a general project

   |Import project|

#. Pick a project name (default volttron) and hit Finish

   |Finish import|

#. Switch to the PyDev perspective

Build VOLTTRON
--------------

Continue the setup process by opening a command shell. Make the current
directory the root of your cloned VOLTTRON directory. Follow the
instructions in our `Building VOLTTRON <Building-VOLTTRON>`__ section of
the wiki and then continue below.

Linking Eclipse and the VOLTTRON Python Environment
---------------------------------------------------

From the Eclipse IDE right click on the project name and select Refresh
so eclipse will be aware of the file system changes. The next step will
define the python version that PyDev will use for VOLTTRON

#. Choose Window - > Preferences
#. Expand the PyDev tree
#. Select Interpreters - > Python Interpreter
#. Click New
#. Click Browse and browse to the pydev-python file located in scripts
   directory off of the volttron source
#. Click Ok

   |Pick Python|

#. Select All, then uncheck the VOLTTRON root like the picture below

   |Select path|

#. Click Ok

.. note::

   You may need redo this stage after platform updates

Make Project a PyDev Project
----------------------------

#. In the Project/PackageExplorer view on the left, right-click on the
   project, PyDev-> Set as PyDev Project
#. Switch to the PyDev perspective (if it has not already switched),
   Window -> Open Perspective -> PyDev
   |Set as Pydev|

Eclipse should now be configured to use the project's environment.

Testing the Installation
------------------------

In order to test the installation the VOLTTRON platform must be running.
You can do this either through `the shell <#execute-volttron-through-shell>`__ or
`through Eclipse <#execute-volttron-through-eclipse>`__.

.. _Execute-Volttron-From-Shell:
Execute VOLTTRON Through Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Open a console and cd into the root of the volttron repository.
#. Execute `source env/bin/activate`
#. Execute `volttron -vv`

   |Execute VOLTTRON in Shell|

You now have a running VOLTTRON logging to standard out. The next step
to verifying the installation is to `start a listeneragent <#start-a-listeneragent>`__.

Execute VOLTTRON Through Eclipse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Click Run -> Run Configuration from the Eclipse Main Menu
#. Click the New Launch Configuration button

   |New Launch Configuration|

#. Change the name and select the main module `volttron/platform/main.py`

   |Main Module|

#. Click the Arguments Tab add '-vv' to the arguments and change the working directory to default

   |Arguments|

#. Click Run. The following image displays the output of a successfully started platform

   |Successful Start|

:ref: _Start-Listener-Eclipse:
Start a ListenerAgent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
    Before attempting to run an agent in Eclipse, please see the note in: :ref:`AgentDevelopment <Agent_Development>`



The listener agent will listen to the message bus for any published
messages. It will also publish a heartbeat message ever 10 seconds (by
default).

Create a new run configuration entry for the listener agent.

#. In the Package Explorer view, open examples -> ListenerAgent -->
   listener
#. Righ-click on agent.py and select Run As -> Python Run (this will
   create a run configuration but fail)
#. On the menu bar, pick Run -> Run Configurations...
#. Under Python Run pick "volttron agent.py"
#. Click on the Arguments tab and Change Working Directory to Default

#. In the Environment tab, click new set the variable to AGENT\_CONFIG
   with the value of /home/git/volttron/examples/ListenerAgent/config

   |Listener Vars|

#. Click Run, this launches the agent

You should see the agent start to publish and receive its own heartbeat
message in the console.

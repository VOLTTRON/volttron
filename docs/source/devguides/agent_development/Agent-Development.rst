.. _Agent-Development:
Agent Creation Walkthrough
--------------------------

It is recommended that developers look at the
`ListenerAgent <https://github.com/VOLTTRON/volttron/tree/master/examples/ListenerAgent>`__
before developing their own agent. That agent expresses the basic
functionality this example will walk through and being familiar with the
concepts will be useful.

Full versions of the files discussed below are at:
:doc:`TestAgent <TestAgent>`

Additional details about the commands used in this walkthrough are at:
:doc:`AgentManagement <AgentManagement>`

Create Folders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Create a new directory called TestAgent.
-  In TestAgent, create a new folder tester, this is the package where
   our python code will be created

Create Agent Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  In tester, create a file called ``__init__.py`` which tells Python to
   treat this folder as a package
-  In the tester package folder, create the file ``agent.py``
-  Create a class called TestAgent

   -  Import the packages and classes we will need:

.. raw:: html

   <!-- -->

::

    import logging
    import sys

    from volttron.platform.vip.agent import Agent, PubSub
    from volttron.platform.agent import utils

- Initialize the logging facility, agents should favor logging over
  print

::

    utils.setup_logging()
    _log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

-  This agent will extend BaseAgent to get all the default functionality

   -  Since we want to publish we will import the PubSub module

.. raw:: html

   <!-- -->

::

    class TestAgent(Agent):

-  Create an init method to deal with creating the agent and getting the
   config file later

   ::

       def __init__(self, config_path, **kwargs):
           super(TestAgent, self).__init__(**kwargs)

Add Configuration Store Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The configuration store is a powerful feature introduced in VOLTTRON 4.
To utilize the configuration store we'll add the a default configuration
and a method that will handle configuration updates.

::

        def __init__(self, config_path, **kwargs):
            super(TestAgent, self).__init__(**kwargs)

            self.setting1 = 42
            self.default_config = {"setting1": self.setting1}

            self.vip.config.set_default("config", self.default_config)
            self.vip.config.subscribe(self.configure, actions=["NEW", "UPDATE"], pattern="config")

        def configure(self, config_name, action, contents):
            config = self.default_config.copy()
            config.update(contents)

            # make sure config variables are valid
            try:
                self.setting1 = int(config["setting1"])
            except ValueError as e:
                _log.error("ERROR PROCESSING CONFIGURATION: {}".format(e))

Values in the default config can be built into the agent or come from the
packaged configuration file. The subscribe method tells our agent which function
to call whenever there is a new or updated config file. For more information
on using the configuration store see :doc:`Agent Configuration Store <Agent-Configuration-Store>`

Setting up a Subscription
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will set our agent up to listen to heartbeat messages (published by
ListenerAgent). Using the PubSub decorator, we declare we want to match
all topics which start with "heartbeat/listeneragent". This will give us
all heartbeat messages from all listeneragents but no others.

::

        @PubSub.subscribe('pubsub', 'heartbeat/listeneragent')
        def on_heartbeat_topic(self, peer, sender, bus, topic, headers, message):
               print "TestAgent got\nTopic: {topic}, {headers}, Message: {message}".format(topic=topic, headers=headers, message=message)

Argument Parsing and Main
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our agent will need to be able to parse arguments being passed on the
command line by the agent launcher. Use the utils.default-main method to
handle argument parsing and other default behavior. Create a main method
which can be called by the launcher.

::

    def main(argv=sys.argv):
        '''Main method called by the platform.'''
        utils.vip_main(TestAgent)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # Entry point for script
        try:
            sys.exit(main())
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            pass

Create Support Files for Agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VOLTTRON agents need some configuration files for packaging,
configuration, and launching.

Packaging Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the TestAgent folder, create a file called "setup.py" (or copy the
setup.py in ListenerAgent) which the platform will use to create a
[wheel].(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wheel). This file sets up the
name, version, required packages, method to execute, etc. for the agent.
The packaging process will also use this information to name the
resulting file.

::

    from setuptools import setup, find_packages

    packages = find_packages('.')
    package = packages[0]

    setup(
        name = package + 'agent',
        version = "0.1",
        install_requires = ['volttron'],
        packages = packages,
        entry_points = {
            'setuptools.installation': [
                'eggsecutable = ' + package + '.agent:main',
            ]
        }
    )

Launch Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In TestAgent, create a file called "testagent.config". This is the file
the platform will use to launch the agent. It can also contain
configuration information for the agent.

For TestAgent,

::

    {
        "agentid": "Test1",
        "message": "hello"    
    }

Agent Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this point, the contents of the TestAgent directory should look like:

::

    TestAgent/
    ├── setup.py
    ├── testagent.config
    └── tester
        ├── agent.py
        └── __init__.py

Packaging Agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The agent code must now be packaged up for use by the platform. The
package command will build the Python wheel using the setup.py file we
defined earlier.

From the project directory, activate the VOLTTRON environment with:

``. env/bin/activate``

Then call:

``volttron-pkg package TestAgent``

By default, this creates a wheel file in the VOLTTRON\_HOME directory
(~/.volttron by default) in the ``packaged`` dreictory. Next, we add our
configuration file to this package with:

``volttron-pkg configure ~/.volttron/packaged/testeragent-0.1-py2-none-any.whl TestAgent/testagent.config``

Installing the Agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we must install it into the platform. Use the following command to install it and add a tag for easily referring to
the agent.

``volttron-ctl install ~/.volttron/packaged/testeragent-0.1-py2-none-any.whl --tag testagent``

To verify it has been installed, use the following command:
``volttron-ctl list``

This will result in output similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

      AGENT           IDENTITY              TAG       PRI
    5 testeragent-0.1 testeragent-0.1_1   testagent

Where the number is the unique portion of the full uuid for the agent (260ca1db-d8ea-43bd-959f-6f90e9a23a67). AGENT is
the "name" of the agent based on the contents of its class name and the version in its setup.py. IDENTITY is the
agent's identity in the platform. This is automatically assigned based on class name and instance number. This agent's
ID is _1 because it is the first instance. TAG is the name we assigned in the command above. PRI is priority for
agents set to autostart with the platform.

When using lifecycle commands on agents, they can be referred to be UUID (default) or AGENT (name) or TAG.


Testing the Agent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the Command Line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To test the agent, we will start the platform, launch the agent, and
check the log file.

-  With the VOLTTRON environment activated, start the platform by
   running

``volttron -l volttron.log -vv&``

-  Launch the agent by <uuid> using the result of the list command:

``volttron-ctl start <uuid>``

-  Launch the agent by name with:

``volttron-ctl start --name testeragent-0.1``

-  Launch the agent by tag with:

``volttron-ctl start --tag testagent``

-  Check that it is :ref:`running <AgentStatus>`:

``volttron-ctl status``

-  Start the ListenerAgent as in :ref:`Building VOLTTRON <Building-VOLTTRON>`
-  Check the log file for messages indicating the TestAgent is receiving
   the ListenerAgents messages:

``tail volttron.log``

::

    2014-09-17 15:30:50,088 (testeragent-0.1 3792) <stdout> INFO: Topic: heartbeat/listeneragent, Headers({u'Date': u'2014-09-17 22:30:50.079548Z', u'AgentID': u'listener1', u'Content-Type': u'text/plain'}), Message:   ['2014-09-17 22:30:50.079548Z']

- Similarly, the agent can be stopped using any of the methods of referring to it with ``volttron-ctl stop``


In Eclipse
^^^^^^^^^^

-  If you are working in Eclipse, create a run configuration for
   TestAgent based on the ListenerAgent configuration in
   EclipseDevEnvironment.
-  Launch the platform
-  Launch the TestAgent
-  Launch the ListenerAgent

TestAgent should start receiving the heartbeats from ListenerAgent

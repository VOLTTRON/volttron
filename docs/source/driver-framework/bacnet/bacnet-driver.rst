BACnet Driver Configuration
===========================

Communicating with BACnet devices requires that the :ref:`BACnet Proxy Agent <BACnet-Proxy-Agent>` is configured and
running.  All device communication happens through this agent.


Requirements
------------
The BACnet driver requires the BACPypes package. This package can be installed in an activated environment with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install bacpypes

Alternatively, running :ref:`bootstrap.py <Platform-Installation>` with the ``--drivers`` option will install all
requirements for drivers included in the repository including BACnet.

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 bootstrap.py --drivers

.. warning::

    Current versions of VOLTTRON support **only** BACPypes version 0.16.7

Driver Config
-------------

There are nine arguments for the `driver_config` section of the device configuration file:

    - **device_address** - Address of the device.  If the target device is behind an IP to MS/TP router then Remote
      Station addressing will probably be needed for the driver to find the device
    - **device_id** - BACnet ID of the device.  Used to establish a route to the device at startup
    - **min_priority** - (Optional) Minimum priority value allowed for this device whether specifying the priority
      manually or via the registry config.  Violating this parameter either in the configuration or when writing to the
      point will result in an error.  Defaults to 8
    - **max_per_request** - (Optional) Configure driver to manually segment read requests. The driver will only grab up
      to the number of objects specified in this setting at most per request.  This setting is primarily for scraping
      many points off of low resource devices that do not support segmentation. Defaults to 10000
    - **proxy_address** - (Optional) :term:`VIP` address of the BACnet proxy. Defaults to ``platform.bacnet_proxy``. See
      :ref:`bacnet-proxy-multiple-networks` for details.  Unless your BACnet network has special needs you should not
      change this value
    - **ping_retry_interval** - (Optional) The driver will ping the device to establish a route at startup. If the
      BACnet proxy is not available the driver will retry the ping at this interval until it succeeds. Defaults to 5
    - **use_read_multiple** - (Optional) During a scrape the driver will tell the proxy to use a
      ReadPropertyMultipleRequest to get data from the device. Otherwise the proxy will use multiple ReadPropertyRequest
      calls. If the BACnet proxy is reporting a device is rejecting requests try changing this to false for that device.
      Be aware that setting this to false will cause scrapes for that device to take much longer. Only change if needed.
      Defaults to true
    - **cov_lifetime** - (Optional) When a device establishes a change of value subscription for a point, this argument
      will be used to determine the lifetime and renewal period for the subscription, in seconds. Defaults to 180
      (Added to Platform Driver version 3.2)

Here is an example device configuration file:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "driver_config": {"device_address": "10.1.1.3",
                          "device_id": 500,
                          "min_priority": 10,
                          "max_per_request": 24
                          },
        "driver_type": "bacnet",
        "registry_config":"config://registry_configs/vav.csv",
        "interval": 5,
        "timezone": "UTC",
        "heart_beat_point": "heartbeat"
    }

can be found in the VOLTTRON repository at `examples/configurations/drivers/bacnet1.config`

BACnet Registry Configuration File
----------------------------------

The registry configuration file is a `CSV <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values>`_ file. Each row
configures a point on the device.

Most of the configuration file can be generated with the `grab_bacnet_config.py` utility in `scripts/bacnet`. See
:ref:`BACnet Auto-Configuration <BACnet-Auto-Configuration>`.

Currently, the driver provides no method to access array type properties even if the members of the array are of a
supported type.

The following columns are required for each row:

    - **Volttron Point Name** - The name by which the platform and agents running on the platform will refer to this
      point.  For instance, if the Volttron Point Name is `HeatCall1` (and using the example device configuration above)
      then an agent would use `pnnl/isb2/hvac1/HeatCall1` to refer to the point when using the RPC interface of the
      Actuator agent
    - **Units** - Used for meta data when creating point information on the historian.
    - **BACnet Object Type** - A string representing what kind of BACnet standard object the point belongs to. Examples
      include:

        * analogInput
        * analogOutput
        * analogValue
        * binaryInput
        * binaryOutput
        * binaryValue
        * multiStateValue

    - **Property** - A string representing the name of the property belonging to the object.  Usually, this will be
      `presentValue`
    - **Writable** - Either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.  Determines if the point can be written to.  Only points labeled `TRUE`
      can be written to through the Actuator Agent.  Points labeled `TRUE` incorrectly will cause an error to be
      returned when an agent attempts to write to the point
    - **Index** - Object ID of the BACnet object

The following columns are optional:

    - **Write Priority** - BACnet priority for writing to this point.  Valid values are 1-16.  Missing this column or
      leaving the column blank will use the default priority of 16
    - **COV Flag** - Either `True` or `False`.  Determines if a BACnet Change-of-Value subscription should be
      established for this point.  Missing this column or leaving the column blank will result in no change of value
      subscriptions being established. (Added to Platform Driver version 3.2)

Any additional columns will be ignored. It is common practice to include a `Point Name` or `Reference Point Name`
column to include the device documentation's name for the point and `Notes` and `Unit Details` columns for additional
information about a point.

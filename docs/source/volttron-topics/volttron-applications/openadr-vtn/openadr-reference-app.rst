.. _OpenADR-Reference-App:

=====================
Reference Application
=====================

This reference application for VOLTTRON's OpenADR Virtual End Node (VEN) and its Simulation
Subsystem demonstrates interactions between the VOLTTRON VEN agent and simulated devices.
It employs a Virtual Top Node (VTN) server, demonstrating the full range of interaction and
communication in a VOLTTRON implementation of the OpenADR (Automated Demand Response) standard.

The simulation subsystem, described in more detail in :ref:`Simulated Subsystem <Simulated-Drivers>`,
includes a set of device simulators and a clock that can run faster (or slower) than
real time (using ReferenceApp's default configuration, the clock runs at normal speed).

Eight VOLTTRON agents work together to run this simulation:

1. **ReferenceAppAgent.** This agent configures, starts, and reports on a simulation.
   It furnishes a variety of configuration parameters to the other simulation agents,
   starts the clock, subscribes to scraped driver points, and generates a CSV output file.
   The ReferenceApp also serves as the mediator between the simulated device drivers and the VEN,
   adjusting driver behavior (particularly the behavior of the "simstorage" battery) while
   an OpenADR event is in progress, and aggregating and relaying relevant driver metrics
   to the VEN for reporting to the VTN.
2. **SimulationClockAgent.** This agent manages the simulation's clock.
   After it has been supplied with a start time, a stop time, and a clock-speed multiplier,
   and it has been asked to start a simulation, it provides the current simulated time
   in response to requests. If no stop time has been provided (this is the default behavior
   while the ReferenceApp is managing the clock), the SimulationClockAgent runs the simulation
   until the agent is stopped. If no clock-speed multiplier has been provided, the simulation
   clock runs at normal wallclock speed.
3. **SimulationDriverAgent.** Like PlatformDriverAgent, this agent is a front-end manager for
   device drivers. It handles get_point/set_point requests from other agents, and it
   periodically "scrapes" and publishes each driver's points. If a device driver has been
   built to run under PlatformDriverAgent, with a few minor modifications (detailed below)
   it can be adapted to run under SimulationDriverAgent.
4. **ActuatorAgent.** This agent manages write access to device drivers. Another agent
   may request a scheduled time period, called a Task, during which it controls a device.
5. **OpenADRVenAgent.** This agent implements an OpenADR Virtual End Node (VEN). It receives
   demand-response event notifications from a Virtual Top Node (VTN), making the event
   information available to the ReferenceAppAgent and other interested VOLTTRON agents.
   It also reports metrics to the VTN based on information furnished by the ReferenceAppAgent.
6. **SQLHistorian.** This agent, a "platform historian," captures metrics reported by the
   simulated devices, storing them in a SQLite database.
7. **VolttronCentralPlatform.** This agent makes the platform historian's device metrics available
   for reporting by the VolttronCentralAgent.
8. **VolttronCentralAgent.** This agent manages a web user interface that can produce graphical
   displays of the simulated device metrics captured by the SQLHistorian.

Three simulated device drivers are used:

1. **storage (simstorage).**  The storage driver simulates an energy storage device (i.e., a
   battery). When it receives a power dispatch value (positive to charge the battery,
   negative to discharge it), it adjusts the storage unit's charging behavior accordingly. Its reported
   power doesn't necessarily match the dispatch value, since (like an actual battery)
   it stays within configured max-charge/max-discharge limits, and power dwindles as its
   state of charge approaches a full or empty state.
2. **pv (simpv).**  The PV driver simulates a photovoltaic array (solar panels), reporting
   the quantity of solar power produced. Solar power is calculated as a function of (simulated)
   time, using a data file of incident-sunlight metrics. A year's worth of solar data has
   been provided as a sample resource.
3. **load (simload).**  The load driver simulates the behavior of a power consumer such
   as a building, reporting the quantity of power consumed. It gets its power metrics as a
   function of (simulated) time from a data file of power readings. A year's worth of
   building-load data has been provided as a sample resource.

Linux Installation
==================

The following steps describe how to set up and run a simulation. They assume that the
``VOLTTRON / volttron`` and ``VOLTTRON / volttron-applications`` repositories have been
downloaded from github.


Installing and running a simulation is walked through in the Jupyter notebook in
``$VOLTTRON_ROOT/examples/JupyterNotebooks/ReferenceAppAgent.ipynb``.
In order to run this notebook, install Jupyter and start the Jupyter server:
::

    $ cd $VOLTTRON_ROOT
    $ source env/bin/activate
    $ pip install jupyter
    $ jupyter notebook

By default, a browser will open with the Jupyter Notebook dashboard at **\http://localhost:8888**.
Run the notebook by navigating in the Jupyter Notebook dashboard
to **\http://localhost:8888/tree/examples/JupyterNotebooks/ReferenceAppAgent.ipynb**.

ReferenceAppAgent Configuration Parameters
==========================================

This section describes ReferenceAppAgents's configurable parameters. Each of these has a
default value and behavior, allowing the simulation to be run “out of the box” without
configuring any parameters.

Storage Driver
--------------

The storage driver's parameters describe the device's power and SOC limits, its initial SOC,
and the SOC thresholds at which charging and discharging start to be reduced as its SOC
approaches a full or empty state. This reduced power is calculated as a straight-line
reduction: charging power is reduced in a straight line from ``reduced_charge_soc_threshold`` to
100% SOC, and discharging power is reduced in a straight line from ``reduced_discharge_soc_threshold``
to 0% SOC.

VEN Configuration

The VEN may be configured according to its documentation :ref:`here <OpenADR-VEN-Agent-Config>`.

Running the Simulation
======================

There are three main ways to monitor the ReferenceApp simulation's progress.

One way is to look at debug trace in VOLTTRON’s log output, for example:

Another way to monitor progress is to launch the VolttronCentral web UI, which can be found
at **\http://127.0.0.1:8080/vc/index.html**.
Here, in addition to checking agent status, one can track metrics reported by the simulated device drivers.
For example, these graphs track the simstorage battery's power consumption and state of charge over time. The abrupt
shift from charging to discharging happens because an OpenADR event has just started:

.. image:: files/2-simulation-out.png

A third way to monitor progress, while there is an active DR event,
is to examine the event's graph in the VTN web UI. This displays the VEN's power consumption,
which is an aggregate of the consumption reported by each simulated device driver:

.. image:: files/3-simulation-out.png

Report Output
-------------

The ReferenceAppAgent also writes a CSV output file so that simulation results can be reported
in a spreadsheet, for example this graph of the simulated storage device:

OpenADR VTN Server: Installation and Configuration
==================================================

The OpenADR VTN server is a partial implementation of the OpenADR VTN specification developed by Kisensum for
interoperability with the VOLTTRON core VEN agent implementation. The VTN server resides in the VOLTTRON applications
repository, and is not supported by the VOLTTRON core team.

Known issues: The Kisensum implementation of the VTN server does not currently include support for registration,
including QueryRegistration requests, create and cancel party requests, etc. Additionally, it does not implement opt-in
behavior as specified by OpenADR. Finally, it has been found that requests containing empty basic authentication will
be served a 403 error, while requests with no authentication will proceed to the correct endpoint normally.

The Kisensum VTN server is a Django application written in Python 3 and utilizing a Postgres database.

.. warning:: 

    If you are planning to install your VTN server on the same system that contains your VOLTTRON instance 
    and you are using RabbitMQ with VOLTTRON, you will need to set up a new instance of RabbitMQ for VTN. 
    In production, the VTN server should be on a different device than VOLTTRON, and as such it is recommended 
    that your VTN server is in it's own VM or on it's own machine. If you still wish to set up two instances 
    of RabbitMQ on the same system, please refer to https://www.rabbitmq.com for further details.


Get Source Code
---------------

To install the VTN server, first get the code by cloning volttron-applications from github
and checking out the openadr software.
::

    $ cd ~/repos
    $ git clone https://github.com/volttron/volttron-applications
    $ cd volttron-applications
    $ git checkout master

Install Python 3
----------------

After installing Python3 on the server, configure an openadr virtual environment:
::

    $ sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
    $ mkdir ~/.virtualenvs (if it doesn’t exist already)

Edit **~/.bashrc** and add these lines:
::

    export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
    export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/repos/volttron-applications/kisensum/openadr
    source virtualenvwrapper.sh

Create the openadr project’s virtual environment:
::

    $ source ~/.bashrc
    $ mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 openadr
    $ setvirtualenvproject openadr ~/repos/volttron-applications/kisensum/openadr
    $ workon openadr

From this point on, use **workon openadr** to operate within the openadr virtual environment.

Create a local site override for Django’s base settings file as follows. First,
create **~/.virtualenvs/openadr/.settings** in a text editor, adding the following line to it:
::

    openadr.settings.site

Then, edit **~/.virtualenvs/openadr/postactivate**, adding the following lines:
::

    PROJECT_PATH=`cat "$VIRTUAL_ENV/$VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PROJECT_FILENAME"`
    PROJECT_ROOT=`dirname $PROJECT_PATH`
    PROJECT_NAME=`basename $PROJECT_PATH`
    SETTINGS_FILENAME=".settings"
    ENV_FILENAME=".env_postactivate.sh"

    # Load the default DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE from a .settings
    # file in the django project root directory.
    export OLD_DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=$DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
    if [ -f $VIRTUAL_ENV/$SETTINGS_FILENAME ]; then
       export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=`cat "$VIRTUAL_ENV/$SETTINGS_FILENAME"`
    fi

Finally, create **$PROJECT_HOME/openadr/openadr/openadr/settings/site.py**, which holds overrides
to base.py, the Django base settings file. At a minimum, this file should contain the following:
::

    from .base import *
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = [‘*’]

A more restrictive ALLOWED_HOSTS setting (e.g. ‘ki-evi.com’) should be used in place of ‘*’ if it is known.

Use Pip to Install Third-Party Software
---------------------------------------
::

    $ workon openadr
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up a Postgres Database
--------------------------

Install postgres.

Create a postgres user.

Create a postgres database named openadr.

(The user name, user password, and database name must match what is in
**$PROJECT_HOME/openadr/openadr/settings/base.py** or the override settings
in **$PROJECT_HOME/openadr/openadr/settings/local.py**.)

You may have to edit **/etc/postgresql/9.5/main/pg_hba.conf** to be 'md5' authorization
for 'local'.

Migrate the Database and Create an Initial Superuser
----------------------------------------------------
::

    $ workon openadr
    $ cd openadr
    $ python manage.py migrate
    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

This is the user that will be used to login to the VTN application for the first time,
and will be able to create other users and groups.

Configure Rabbitmq
------------------

rabbitmq is used by celery, which manages the openadr server’s periodic tasks.

Install and run rabbitmq as follows (for further information, see http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html):
::

    $ sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server

Start the rabbitmq server if it isn't already running:
::

    $ sudo rabbitmq-server -detached (note the single dash)

Start the VTN Server
--------------------
::

    $ workon openadr
    $ cd openadr
    $ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

Start Celery
------------

::

    $ workon openadr
    $ cd openadr
    $ celery -A openadr worker -B

Configuration Parameters
------------------------

The VTN supports the following configuration parameters, which can be found in
**base.py** and overriden in **site.py**:

========================= ======================== ====================================================
Parameter                 Example                  Description
========================= ======================== ====================================================
VTN_ID                    “vtn01”                  OpenADR ID of this virtual top node. Virtual end
                                                   nodes must know this VTN_ID to be able to
                                                   communicate with the VTN.
ONLINE_INTERVAL_MINUTES   15                       The amount of time, in minutes, that determines how
                                                   long the VTN will wait until displaying a given VEN
                                                   offline. In other words, if the VTN does not receive
                                                   any communication from a given VEN within
                                                   ONLINE_INTERVAL_MINUTES minutes, the VTN will display
                                                   said VEN as offline.
GRAPH_TIMECHUNK_SECONDS   360                      The VTN displays DR Event graph data by averaging
                                                   individual VENs' telemetry by GRAPH_TIMECHUNK_SECONDS
                                                   seconds. This value should be adjusted according to
                                                   how often VENs are sending the VTN telemetry.

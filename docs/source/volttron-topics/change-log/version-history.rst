- Python 3.7 has conflicts with some libraries such as gevent
- The VOLTTRON Central agent is not fully integrated into Python3
- CFFI library has conflicts on the Raspian OS which interferes with bootstrapping


VOLTTRON 7.0 Full Release
=========================

This is a full release of the 7.0 version of VOLTTRON which has been refactored to work with Python3.  This release
incorporates community feedback from the release candidate as well as new contributions and features.
Major new features and highlights since the release candidate include:

* Added secure agent user feature which allows agents to be launched as a user separate from the platform.  This
  protects the platform against malformed or malicious agents accessing platform level files
* Added a driver to interface with the Ecobee smart thermostat and make data available to agents on the platform
* Updated VOLTTRON Central UI to work with Python3
* Added web support to authenticate remote VOLTTRON ZMQ message bus-based connections
* Updated ZMQ-based multiplatform RPC with Python 3
* To reduce installation size and complexity, fewer services are installed by default
* MasterDriver dependencies are not installed by default during bootstrap.  To use MasterDriver, please use the
  following command:

  .. code-block:: bash

     python3 bootstrap.py --driver

* Web dependencies are not installed by default during bootstrap.  To use the MasterWeb service, please use the
  following command:

  .. code-block:: bash

     python3 bootstrap.py --web

* Added initial version of test cases for `volttron-cfg` (`vcfg`) utility
* On all arm-based systems, `libffi` is now a required dependency, this is reflected in the installation instructions
* On arm-based systems, Raspbian >= 10 or Ubuntu >= 18.04 is required
* Updated examples and several contributed features to Python 3
* Inclusion of docker in test handling for databases
* A new `/gs` endpoint to access platform services without using Volttron Central through Json-RPC
* A new SCPAgent to transfer files between two remote systems

Known Issues
------------

* Continued documentation updates to ensure correctness
* Rainforest Eagle driver is not yet upgraded to Python3
* A bug in the Modbus TK library prevents creating connections from 2 different masters to a single slave.
* BACnet Proxy Agent and BACnet auto configuration scripts require the version of BACPypes installed in the virtual
  environment of VOLTTRON to be version 0.16.7.  We have pinned it to version 0.16.7 since it does not work properly in
  later versions of BACPypes.
* VOLTTRON 7.0 code base is not fully tested in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS so issues with this combination have not been addressed

Config Actuation Example
=========================

The ConfigActuation example attempts to set points on a device when files
are added or updated in its :ref:`configuration store <VOLTTRON-Configuration-Store>`.


Configuration
-------------

The name of a configuration file must match the name of the device to
be actuated. The configuration file is a json dictionary of point name and value
pairs. Any number of points on the device can be listed in the config.

.. code-block:: python

    {
        "point0": value,
        "point1": value
    }

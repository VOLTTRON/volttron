Scripts
=======

In order to make repetitive tasks less repetitive the VOLTTRON team has
create several scripts in order to help. These tasks are available in
the scripts directory. Before using these scripts you should become
familiar with the `Agent Development <Agent-Development>`__ process.

In addition to the scripts directory, the VOLTTRON team has added the
config directory to the .gitignore file. By convention this is where we
store customized scripts and configuration that will not be made public.
Please feel free to use this convention in your own processes.

The scripts/core directory is laid out in such a way that we can build
scripts on top of a base core. For example the scripts in sub-folders
such as the management-service-demo, historian-scripts, and demo-commsa
all use the scripts that are present in the core directory.

The most widely used script is scripts/core/pack\_install.sh. The
pack\_install.sh script will remove an agent if the tag is already
present, create a new agent package, and install the agent to
VOLTTRON\_HOME. This script has three required arguments and has the
following signature

::

    # Agent to Package must have a setup.py in the root of the directory.
    scripts/core/pack_install.sh <Agent to Package> <Config file> <Tag>

The pack\_install.sh script will respect the VOLTTRON\_HOME specified on
the command line or set in the global environment. An example of setting
VOLTTRON\_HOME is as follows.

::

    # Sets VOLTTRON_HOME to /tmp/v1home 
    VOLTTRON_HOME=/tmp/v1home scripts/core/pack_install.sh <Agent to Package> <Config file> <Tag>

Use the following scripts as examples that can be modified for your own
agents.

-  ``scripts/core/make-listener`` can be modified for any agent and make
   it one command to stop, remove, build, install, configure, tag,
   start, and (optionally) enable an agent for autostart. Fill out the
   script with the location of the agent source, config file, and tag
   name. The optional parameter ``enable`` can be passed to the
   ``make-agent`` script to set the agent to autostart with the
   platform.

-  ``make-listener-enc-auth`` is similar to make-listener but uses
   `encryption and authentication <VIP-Authentication>`__.

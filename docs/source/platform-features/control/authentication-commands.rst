Authentication record
---------------------

An authentication record consist of following parameters

.. code-block:: console

    domain []:
    address []: Either a single agent identity or an array of agents identities
    user_id []: Arbitrary string to identify the agent
    identity []: agents vip identity, if provided
    capabilities (delimit multiple entries with comma) []: Array of strings referring to authorized capabilities defined by exported RPC methods
    rpc_method_authorizations []: Dictionary containing the agent's exported RPC methods, and the authorized capabilities for each. Will populate on startup.
    roles (delimit multiple entries with comma) []:
    groups (delimit multiple entries with comma) []:
    mechanism [CURVE]:
    credentials []: Public key string for the agent
    comments []:
    enabled [True]:

For more details on how to create authentication record, please see section
:ref:`Agent Authentication <Agent-Authentication>`


.. _Agent-Authentication:

How to authenticate an agent to communicate with VOLTTRON platform
==================================================================

An administrator can allow an agent to communicate with VOLTTRON platform by creating an authentication record for that
agent.  An authentication record is created by using :code:`vctl auth add` command and entering values to asked
arguments.

.. code-block:: console

    vctl auth add

        domain []:
        address []:
        user_id []:
        identity []:
        capabilities (delimit multiple entries with comma) []:
        roles (delimit multiple entries with comma) []:
        groups (delimit multiple entries with comma) []:
        mechanism [CURVE]:
        credentials []:
        comments []:
        enabled [True]:

The listed fields can also be specified on the command line:

.. code-block:: console

    vctl auth add --user_id bob --credentials ABCD...

If any field is specified on the command line, then the interactive menu
will not be used.

The simplest way of creating an authentication record is by entering the user_id and credential values.
User_id is a arbitrary string for VOLTTRON to identify the agent. Credential is the encoded public key string
for the agent. Create a public/private key pair for the agent and enter encoded public key for credential parameter.

.. code-block:: console

    vctl auth add

        domain []:
        address []:
        user_id []: my-test-agent
        capabilities (delimit multiple entries with comma) []:
        roles (delimit multiple entries with comma) []:
        groups (delimit multiple entries with comma) []:
        mechanism [CURVE]:
        credentials []: encoded-public-key-for-my-test-agent
        comments []:
        enabled [True]:


In next sections, we will discuss each parameter, its purpose and what all values it can take.

Domain:
-------
Domain is the name assigned to locally bound address. Domain parameter is currently not being used in VOLTTRON and is placeholder for future implementation.

Address:
--------
By specifying address, administrator can allow an agent to connect with VOLTTRON only if that agent is running on that address.
Address parameter can take a string representing an IP addresses.
It can also take a regular expression representing a range of IP addresses.

.. code-block:: console

    address []: 192.168.111.1
    address []: /192.168.*/

User_id:
--------
User_id can be any arbitrary string that is used to identify the agent by the platform.
If a regular expression is used for address or credential to combine agents in an authentication record then all
those agents will be identified by this user_id. It is primarily used for identifying agents during logging.

Identity:
---------
An identity is a string that represents the agent's VIP identity. This is an optional field, used by the platform to
communicate between agents via RPC calls. It should be set if an agent has RPC exports.


Capabilities:
-------------
A capability is a string used by an agent to constrain its exported RPC method.
Only agents who have that capability listed in their authentication record will be able to access that RPC method.

If an administrator wants to authorize an agent to access an exported RPC method with a specific capability
on another agent, the administrator can list that capability string in this parameter.
The capability parameter takes a string, an array of strings, or the string representation of dictionary
listing all the capabilities this agent is authorized to access.

The agent will have access to all corresponding exported RPC methods of other agents that are
constrained by the listed capabilities. For example, if there is an AgentA with capability enables exported
RPC method and AgentB needs to access that method then AgentA's code and AgentB's authentication record
would be as follows:


AgentA's capability enabled exported RPC method:

::

   @RPC.export
   @RPC.allow('can_call_bar')
   def bar(self):
      return 'If you can see this, then you have the required capabilities'


AgentB's authentication record to access bar method:

.. code-block:: console

    volttron-ctl auth add

        domain []:
        address []:
        user_id []: agent-b
        capabilities (delimit multiple entries with comma) []: can_call_bar
        roles (delimit multiple entries with comma) []:
        groups (delimit multiple entries with comma) []:
        mechanism [NULL]: CURVE
        credentials []: encoded-public-key-for-agent-b
        comments []:
        enabled [True]:


Similarly, the capability parameter can take an array of strings:

.. code-block:: console

    capabilities (delimit multiple entries with comma) []: can_call_bar
    capabilities (delimit multiple entries with comma) []: can_call_method1, can_call_method2

Capabilities can also be used to restrict access to a rpc method with specific parameter values.
For example, if AgentA exposes a method bar which accepts parameter x


AgentA's capability enabled exported RPC method:

::

   @RPC.export
   @RPC.allow('can_call_bar')
   def bar(self, x):
      return 'If you can see this, then you have the required capabilities'

You can restrict access to AgentA's bar method to AgentB with x=1.
To add this auth entry use the vctl auth add command shown below.

::

   vctl auth add --capabilities '{"test1_cap2":{"x":1}}' --user_id AgentB --credential vELQORgWOUcXo69DsSmHiCCLesJPa4-CtVfvoNHwIR0

The auth.json file entry for the above command would be:

::

    {
      "domain": null,
      "user_id": "AgentB",
      "roles": [],
      "enabled": true,
      "mechanism": "CURVE",
      "capabilities": {
        "test1_cap2": {
          "x": 1
        }
      },
      "groups": [],
      "address": null,
      "credentials": "vELQORgWOUcXo69DsSmHiCCLesJPa4-CtVfvoNHwIR0",
      "comments": null
    }



Parameter values can also be regular expressions. For example, the following command will allow any agent with

::

    (volttron)volttron@volttron1:~/git/myvolttron$ vctl auth add
    domain []:
    address []:
    user_id []:
    capabilities (delimit multiple entries with comma) []: {'test1_cap2':{'x':'/.*'}}
    roles (delimit multiple entries with comma) []:
    groups (delimit multiple entries with comma) []:
    mechanism [CURVE]:
    credentials []: vELQORgWOUcXo69DsSmHiCCLesJPa4-CtVfvoNHwIR0
    comments []:
    enabled [True]:
    added entry domain=None, address=None, mechanism='CURVE', credentials=u'vELQORgWOUcXo69DsSmHiCCLesJPa4-CtVfvoNHwIR0', user_id='b22e041d-ec21-4f78-b32e-ab7138c22373'


auth.json file entry for the above command would be:

::

    {
      "domain": null,
      "user_id": "90f8ef35-4407-49d8-8863-4220e95974c7",
      "roles": [],
      "enabled": true,
      "mechanism": "CURVE",
      "capabilities": {
        "test1_cap2": {
          "x": "/.*"
        }
      },
      "groups": [],
      "address": null,
      "credentials": "vELQORgWOUcXo69DsSmHiCCLesJPa4-CtVfvoNHwIR0",
      "comments": null
    }

Roles:
-------
A role is a name for a set of capabilities. Roles can be used to grant an agent
multiple capabilities without listing each capability in the in the agent's
authorization entry. Capabilities can be fully utilized without roles. Roles
are purely for organizing sets of capabilities.

Roles can be viewed and edited with the following commands:

- ``vctl auth add-role``
- ``vctl auth list-roles``
- ``vctl auth remove-role``
- ``vctl auth updated-role``

For example, suppose agents protect certain methods with the following capabilites:
``READ_BUILDING_A_TEMP``, ``SET_BUILDING_A_TEMP``, ``READ_BUILDLING_B_TEMP``,
and ``SET_BUILDING_B_TEMP``.

These capabilities can be organized into various roles:

.. code-block:: console

    vctl auth add-role TEMP_READER READ_BUILDING_A_TEMP READ_BUILDLING_B_TEMP
    vctl auth add-role BUILDING_A_ADMIN READ_BUILDING_A_TEMP SET_BUILDING_A_TEMP
    vctl auth add-role BUILDING_B_ADMIN READ_BUILDING_B_TEMP SET_BUILDING_B_TEMP

To view these roles run ``vctl auth list-roles``:

.. code-block:: console

    ROLE              CAPABILITIES
    ----              ------------
    BUILDING_A_ADMIN  ['READ_BUILDING_A_TEMP', 'SET_BUILDING_A_TEMP']
    BUILDING_B_ADMIN  ['READ_BUILDING_B_TEMP', 'SET_BUILDING_B_TEMP']
    TEMP_READER       ['READ_BUILDING_A_TEMP', 'READ_BUILDLING_B_TEMP']

With this configuration, adding the ``BUILDING_A_ADMIN`` role to an agent's
authorization entry implicitly grants that agent the
``READ_BUILDING_A_TEMP`` and ``SET_BUILDING_A_TEMP`` capabilities.

To add a new capabilities to an existing role:

.. code-block:: console

   vctl auth update-role BUILDING_A_ADMIN CLEAR_ALARM TRIGGER_ALARM

To remove a capability from a role:

.. code-block:: console

   vctl auth update-role BUILDING_A_ADMIN TRIGGER_ALARM --remove


Groups:
-------
Groups provide one more layer of *grouping*. A group is a named set of roles.
Like roles, groups are optional and are meant to help with organization.

Groups can be viewed and edited with the following commands:

- ``vctl auth add-group``
- ``vctl auth list-groups``
- ``vctl auth remove-group``
- ``vctl auth updated-group``

These commands behave the same as the *role* commands. For example, to
further organize the capabilities in the previous section, one could create
create an ``ALL_BUILDING_ADMIN`` group:

.. code-block:: console

    vctl auth add-group ALL_BUILDING_ADMIN BUILDING_A_ADMIN BUILDING_B_ADMIN

With this configuration, agents in the ``ALL_BUILDING_ADMIN`` group would
implicity have the ``BUILDING_A_ADMIN`` and ``BUILDING_B_ADMIN`` roles. This means
such agents would implicity be granted the following capabilities:
``READ_BUILDING_A_TEMP``, ``SET_BUILDING_A_TEMP``, ``READ_BUILDLING_B_TEMP``,
and ``SET_BUILDING_B_TEMP``.


Mechanism:
-----------
Mechanism is the authentication method by which the agent will communicate with VOLTTRON platform. Currently VOLTTRON uses only CURVE mechanism to authenticate agents.


Credentials:
-------------

The credentials field must be an CURVE encoded public key (see `volttron.platform.vip.socket.encode_key` for method to encode public key).

.. code-block:: console

    credentials []: encoded-public-key-for-agent


Comments:
----------
Comments is arbitrary string to associate with authentication record


Enabled:
---------
TRUE of FALSE value to enable or disable the authentication record.
Record will only be used if this value is True


Remote Agent Management
=======================

The remote sub-parser allows the user to manage connections to remote platforms and agents.
This functionality is comparable to that provided by the admin webpage, and requires the
volttron instance to be web enabled. In addition, when working with RMQ based CSRs, the RMQ messagebus must be used.

All remote sub-commands can be viewed by entering following command:

.. code-block:: console

    vctl auth remote --help

.. code-block:: console

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -c FILE, --config FILE
                            read configuration from FILE
      --debug               show tracebacks for errors rather than a brief message
      -t SECS, --timeout SECS
                            timeout in seconds for remote calls (default: 60)
      --msgdebug MSGDEBUG   route all messages to an agent while debugging
      --vip-address ZMQADDR
                            ZeroMQ URL to bind for VIP connections

    remote subcommands:

        list                lists approved, denied, and pending certs and
                            credentials
        approve             approves pending or denied remote connection
        deny                denies pending or denied remote connection
        delete              approves pending or denied remote connection


The four primary actions are list, approve, deny, and delete.
List displays all remote CSRs and ZMQ credentials, their address,
and current status, either APPROVED, DENIED, or PENDING.

.. code-block:: console

    USER_ID                              ADDRESS        STATUS
    volttron1.volttron1.platform.agent   192.168.56.101 PENDING
    917a5da0-5a85-4201-b7d8-cd8c3959f391 127.0.0.1      PENDING

To accept a pending cert/credential, use:

.. code-block:: console

    vctl auth remote approve <USER_ID>

The USER_ID can be taken directly from vctl auth remote list.

To deny a pending cert/credential, use:

.. code-block:: console

    vctl auth remote deny <USER_ID>


Once a cert/credential has been approved or denied, the status will change.

.. code-block::

    USER_ID                              ADDRESS        STATUS
    volttron1.volttron1.platform.agent   192.168.56.101 APPROVED
    917a5da0-5a85-4201-b7d8-cd8c3959f391 127.0.0.1      DENIED


The status of an approved or denied cert is persistent. A user may deny a previously approved cert/credential,
or approve a previously denied cert/credential. However, if a cert or credential is deleted, then the remote instance
must resend the request.

A request can be deleted using the following command:

.. code-block::

    vctl auth remote delete <USER_ID>


Dynamic RPC Method Authorization
================================
RPC method authorizations are the capabilities used to limit access to specific exported RPC methods on an agent.
While the capability field is used to define which exported RPC methods the agent can access, the rpc_method_authorization
field describes which capabilities will authorize a remote agent to access it's exported RPC methods.

.. note::
    While this field can be modified manually, it is best practice to use the interface.
    When the agent starts up, it will query the AuthService for all current allowed rpc capabilities on each method.

The format for rpc_method_authorizations is as follows:

.. code-block:: json

    rpc_method_authorizations: {
        "RPC_exported_method_1": [
            "authorized_capability_1",
            "authorized_capability_2"
            ],
        "RPC_exported_method_2": [
            "authorized_capability_3",
            ]
    }

To dynamically modify an RPC method's authorization, use:

.. code-block:: console

    vctl auth rpc add <agent_id.method> <authorized capability 1> <authorized capability 2> ...

For example, AgentA has an RPC exported method 'bar' which can be called by any other agent.

::

   @RPC.export
   def bar(self, x):
      return 'If you can see this, then you have the required capabilities'

If you wanted the bar method to only be accessible to an agent with the "can_call_bar" capability, you could restrict
access to the bar method on AgentA using the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    vctl auth rpc add AgentA.bar can_call_bar

This would be equivalent to having written the agent method as:

::

   @RPC.export
   @RPC.allow("can_call_bar")
   def bar(self, x):
      return 'If you can see this, then you have the required capabilities'

Although it would be possible to re-write the agent method in the above manner, a restart of the agent would be
required for the change to take effect. By using the vctl command, the method's authorization is updated on the fly.

On the other hand, if you wish to remove an rpc authorization from an agent dynamically, you can use the ``remove`` command.

As in the above example, AgentA has a method 'bar', which can only be called by agents with the "can_call_bar" capability.
Since you want bar to be accessible to all agents, regardless of their capabilities, you could use the command:

.. code-block:: console

    vctl auth rpc remove AgentA.bar can_call_bar

VOLTTRON\ :sup:`TM`\  documentation!
====================================

|VOLTTRON Tagline|

VOLTTRON\ :sup:`TM` is an open-source platform for distributed sensing and control. The platform provides services for collecting and storing data from buildings and devices and provides an environment for developing applications
that interact with that data.

Features
--------

Out of the box VOLTTRON provides:

- a secure :ref:`message bus <messagebus index>` allowing agents to subcribe to data sources and publish results and messages.
- secure connectivity between multiple instances.
- BACnet, ModBus and other device/system protocol connectivity through our :ref:`driver framework <VOLTTRON-Driver-Framework>` for collecting data from and sending control actions to buildings and devices.
- automatic data capture and retrieval through our :ref:`historian framework <Historian Index>`.
- platform based :ref:`agent lifecycle managment <AgentManagement>`.
- a :ref:`web based management <VOLTTRON-Central>` tool for managing several instances from a central instance.
- the ability to easily extend the functionality of existing agents or create new ones for your specific purposes.


Background
----------

VOLTTRON\ :sup:`TM` is written in Python 2.7 and runs on Linux Operating Systems. For users unfamiliar with those technologies, the following resources are recommended:

- https://docs.python.org/2.7/tutorial/
- http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/


Installation
------------

:ref:`Install VOLTTRON <install>` by running the following commands that installs needed
:ref:`prerequisites <VOLTTRON-Prerequisites>`, clones the source code, then builds the virtual environment for using the platform.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev openssl libssl-dev libevent-dev git
    git clone https://github.com/VOLTTRON/volttron
    cd volttron
    python bootstrap.py

This will build the platform and create a virtual Python environment. Activate this and then start the platform with:

.. code-block:: bash

    . env/bin/activate
    volttron -vv -l volttron.log&

This enters the virtual Python environment and then starts the platform in debug (vv) mode with a log file named volttron.log.

Next, start an example listener to see it publish and subscribe to the message bus:

.. code-block:: bash

    scripts/core/make-listener


This script handles several different commands for installing and starting an agent after removing an old copy. This simple agent publishes a heartbeat message and listens to everything on the message bus. Look at the VOLTTRON log
to see the activity:

.. code-block:: bash

    tail volttron.log

Results in:

.. code-block:: console

   2016-10-17 18:17:52,245 (listeneragent-3.2 11367) listener.agent INFO: Peer: 'pubsub', Sender: 'listeneragent-3.2_1'
   :, Bus: u'', Topic: 'heartbeat/ListenerAgent/f230df97-658e-45d3-8165-18a2ec834d3f', Headers:
   {'Date': '2016-10-18T01:17:52.239724+00:00', 'max_compatible_version': u'', 'min_compatible_version': '3.0'},
   Message: {'status': 'GOOD', 'last_updated': '2016-10-18T01:17:47.232972+00:00', 'context': 'hello'}

Stop the platform:

.. code-block:: bash

   volttron-ctl shutdown --platform


Next Steps
-----------

There are several :ref:`walkthroughs <devguides_index>` to explore additional aspects of the platform:

- :ref:`Agent Development Walkthrough <Agent-Development>`
- Demonstration of :ref:`the management UI <VOLTTRON-Central-Demo>`


Acquiring Third Party Agent Code
---------------------------------

Third party agents are available under volttron-applications repository. In order to use those agents, add
volttron-applications repository under the volttron/applications directory by using following command:


    git subtree add --prefix applications https://github.com/VOLTTRON/volttron-applications.git develop --squash

Messaging and Topics
====================

Introduction
------------

Agents in VOLTTRON(tm) communicate with each other using a
publish/subscribe mechanism built on the Zero MQ Python library. This
allows for great flexibility as topics can be created dynamically and
the messages sent can be any format as long as the sender and receiver
understand it. An agent with data to share publishes to a topic, then
any agents interested in that data subscribe to that topic.

While this flexibility is powerful, it also could also lead to confusion
if some standard is not followed. The current conventions for
communicating in the VOLTTRON are:

-  Topics and subtopics follow the format: topic/subtopic/subtopic
-  Subscribers can subscribe to any and all levels. Subscriptions to
   "topic" will include messages for the base topic and all subtopics.
   Subscriptions to "topic/subtopic1" will only receive messages for
   that subtopic and any children subtopics. Subscriptions to empty
   string ("") will receive ALL messages. This is not recommended.

   -  All agents should subscribe to the "platform" topic. This is the
      topic the VOLTTRON will use to send messages to agents, such as
      "shutdown".

Agents should set the "From" header. This will allow agents to filter on
the "To" message sent back. This is especially useful for requests to
the ArchiverAgent so agents do not receive replies not meant for their
request.

Topics
------

In VOLTTRON
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  platform - Base topic used by the platform to inform agents of
   platform events
-  platform/shutdown - General shutdown command. All agents should exit
   upon receiving this. Message content will be a reason for the
   shutdown
-  platform/shutdown\_agent - This topic will provide a specific agent
   id. Agents should subscribe to this topic and exit if the id in the
   message matches their id.

-  devices - Base topic for data being published by drivers
-  datalogger - Base topic for agents wishing to record time series data
-  record - Base topic for agents to record data in an arbitrary format.

VOLTTRON Security
=================

There are various security-related topics throughout VOLTTRON's documentation.
This is a quick roadmap for finding security documentaion.

A core component of VOLTTRON is its :ref:`message bus<messagebus index>`.
The security of this message bus is crucial to the entire system.
The :ref:`VOLTTRON Interconnect Protocol<VIP-Overview>` provides
communication over the message bus. VIP was built with security in mind
from the ground up. VIP uses encrypted channels and enforces agent
:ref:`authentication<VIP-Authentication>` by default for all network communication.
VIP's :ref:`authorization<VIP-Authorization>` mechanism allows system 
administrators to limit agent capabilities with fine granularity.

Even with these security mechanisms built into VOLTTRON, it is important
for system administrators to 
:ref:`harden VOLTTRON's underlying OS<Platform-Hardening-for-VOLTTRON>`.

Additional documentation related to VIP authentication and authorization
is avaiable here:

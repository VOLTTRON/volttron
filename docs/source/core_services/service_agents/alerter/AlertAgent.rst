.. _AlertAgent:

Alert Agent
===========

The Alert Agent listens to a set of configured topics and publishes an alert if
they are not published within some time limit. In addition to "standard" topics
the Alert Agent supports inspecting device `all` topics. This can be useful when
a device contains volatile points that may not be published.


Configuration
-------------

Topics are organied by groups. Any alerts raised will summarize all missing
topics in the group.

Individual topics have two configuration options. For standard topics
configuration consists of a key value pair of the topic to its time limit.

The other option is for `all` publishes. The topic key is paired with a
dictionary that has two keys, `"seconds"` and `"points"`. `"seconds"` is the
topic's time limit and `"points"` is a list of points to watch.

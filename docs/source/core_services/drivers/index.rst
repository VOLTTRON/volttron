VOLTTRON Driver Framework
=========================

All Voltton drivers are implemented through the Master Driver Agent and are technically sub-agents 
running in the same process as the Master Driver Agent. Each of these driver sub-agents is responsible 
for creating an interface to a single device. Creating that interface is facilitated by an instance of 
an interface class. Currently there are two interface classes included: Modbus and BACnet.

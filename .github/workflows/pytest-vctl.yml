# This workflow is meant as a foundational workflow for running integration/unit tests on multiple targeted
# ubuntu versions with multiple python versions.
#
# This workflow utilizes the build-dependency-cache workflow which sets up the environment dependencies using
# bootstrap.py --all
#

# Documentation for the syntax of this file is located
# https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions

# The workflow name will show up in the action tab on github during execution
# https://github.com/VOLTTRON/volttron/actions (or if you are pushing to your own fork change the user)
